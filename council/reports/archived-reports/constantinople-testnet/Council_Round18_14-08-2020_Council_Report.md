## 3 - Review
### 3.1 - Workflow, Performance, Challenged & Thinking
* @tomato
	* This council session was fairly productive, as a result of the Telegram bot being active it a lot easier for council members to know when proposals have been submitted. We also have to manage a new regular proposal for refilling the storage mint, which means the expectation of efficiently voting on proposals has increased. Proposals still overall took a significant amount of time to be voted on in some instances, but with the new KPI system I'm hoping we will see proposals move through quicker. We also have the new role of Council Secretary which I was able to successfully apply for, hopefully this will make the council's activities more transparent and streamlined.


## 4 - Obligations
Council obligations are payments or items that carry through council sessions. These are noted so that future councils can easily see what items they should be aware of. Items can be removed from here once they have been resolved or become outdated.
### 4.1 Regular Payments / Proposals
- Council Mint
	- The council mint needs to be checked on a regular basis and in the event it is near depletion, a council member should notify a member of Jsgenesis in order for it to be refilled.
	- The council mint is set at a value decided by Jsgenesis.
- Council Roles
	- Council Secretary
		- This role was introduced in Council Round #18 and the current payment is 2 million tokens per council round
- Content Curator Mint
	- The Content Curator Mint currently has a maximum value of 1 million tokens.
	- The Content Curator Mint has to be filled periodically and the agreed amount was discussed earlier. The amount may change in the future, but the rewards for this role are dependent on the council passing these proposals in a timely fashion.
	- The Content Curator Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
- Storage Mint
	- The Storage Mint currently has a maximum value of 1 million tokens.
	- This mint has be refilled periodically
	- The Storage Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
