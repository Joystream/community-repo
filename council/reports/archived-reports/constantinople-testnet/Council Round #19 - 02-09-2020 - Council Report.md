## 3 - Review
### 3.1 - Workflow, Performance, Challenged & Thinking
* @tomato
	* This council session was fairly productive, we still had issues with CM participation but I didn't notice any proposals that took an overly long amount of time to pass. The storage role mint proposals are one of the most frequent we have to vote on currently, but these do not seem to pass any quicker than other proposal types. This session I submitted a council budget, which was approved and I'll continue to add detail/perfect this as we progress.
	* One mistake that was made during this council round was that the council approved 2 SetContentWorkingGroupMintCapacity proposals (#67 + #68) that were marked as being storage mint proposals. I think this must have just been confusion from who created the proposals, as the storage mint proposal is called SetWorkingGroupMintCapacity and is similar. This mistake has no real effects and I'm guessing there was no intent at deceiving the council, but someone on the council should've noticed this was the wrong proposal type and voted to reject.
* @freakstatic_council
	* In this session the council was a bit more active comparing to the previous one. Some interesting ideas were present that may increase the members participation in things. The council budget seems to going well thanks to @tomato for leading this task

## 4 - Obligations
Council obligations are payments or items that carry through council sessions. These are noted so that future councils can easily see what items they should be aware of. Items can be removed from here once they have been resolved or become outdated.
### 4.1 Documents / Processes
- Council Report
	- Each council should produce a report which highlights important events, council participation, mint spending and other important facts surrounding the council term
- Council Budget
	- This is a proposal which tries to guide how many tokens the current council may have available to it during a term. This is a non binding proposal, so is mainly used as a guide for now.
### 4.2 Regular Payments / Proposals
- Council Mint
	- The council mint needs to be checked on a regular basis and in the event it is near depletion, a council member should notify a member of Jsgenesis in order for it to be refilled.
	- The council mint is set at a value decided by Jsgenesis.
- Council Roles
	- Council Secretary
		- This role was introduced in Council Round #18 and the current payment is 2 million tokens per council round
- Content Curator Mint
	- The Content Curator Mint currently has a maximum value of 1 million tokens.
	- The Content Curator Mint has to be filled periodically and the agreed amount was discussed earlier. The amount may change in the future, but the rewards for this role are dependent on the council passing these proposals in a timely fashion.
	- The Content Curator Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
- Storage Mint
	- The Storage Mint currently has a maximum value of 1 million tokens.
	- This mint has be refilled periodically
	- The Storage Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
