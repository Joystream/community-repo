## Council Member Leaderboard
This table shows how often each council member participates in voting for proposals.
Notes:
* Once a proposal is finalized it cannot be voted on further, so a lower number does not necessarily mean a council member did not want to vote, it may just be the proposal passed before they had a chance to.
* Canceled proposals and proposals that do not successfully get voted on by the current council are not included.
* An `x` means the CM was not elected during that council session
