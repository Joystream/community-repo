- No Storage Role Spot Check was done

## 3 - Review
### 3.1 - Workflow, Performance, Challenged & Thinking
* freakstatic_council
	* I think that this council session had some problems due to low activity of the current council. Several proposals fail since they didn't get enough votes or took too long to be approved.
	Another problem, this time my fault, was that the
	proposal to hire a new council secretary had fail since the council mint didn't had enough funds. The next council should pay more attention to this and to the remaining KPIs.
	Since some council members had apply for the next council election but still haven't vote in the current proposals maybe a reward system to vote could improve this, to make sure that the council members are rewarded to work and don't apply just to earn some tokens.
* tomato
	* Perhaps the relationship between salary and KPI rewards could be adjusted? So less rewards for just being a CM, but more proportion of rewards surrounding KPIs? That way there is more incentive to participating...
* freakstatic_council
	* This seems like a good idea! I think that the salary should be greatly reduced and some basic KPIs should be created. Ex: "All proposals are voted in less that 2 days. " I think that a similar KPI was active in the previous council round btw...

## 4 - Obligations
Council obligations are payments or items that carry through council sessions. These are noted so that future councils can easily see what items they should be aware of. Items can be removed from here once they have been resolved or become outdated.

### 4.1 Current Documents / Processes
- Council Report
	- Each council should produce a report which highlights important events, council participation, mint spending and other important facts surrounding the council term
- Council Budget
	- This is a proposal which tries to guide how many tokens the current council may have available to it during a term. This is a non binding proposal, so is mainly used as a guide for now.

### 4.2 Documents WIP
- Tokenomics Reports
	- This is a periodic report which should be produced after each council round has concluded. It should serve as a tool to see the overall economics of the platform.
- Working Group Evaluations
	- This was introduced in KPI 15.5 and should serve as a way of evaluting the working groups, so far it hasn't been produced fully.

### 4.2 Regular Payments / Proposals
- Council Mint
	- The council mint needs to be checked on a regular basis and in the event it is near depletion, a council member should notify a member of Jsgenesis in order for it to be refilled.
	- The council mint is set at a value decided by Jsgenesis.
- Council Roles
	- Council Secretary
		- This role was introduced in Council Round #18 and the current payment is 2 million tokens per council round
- Content Curator Mint
	- The Content Curator Mint currently has a maximum value of 1 million tokens.
	- The Content Curator Mint has to be filled periodically and the agreed amount was discussed earlier. The amount may change in the future, but the rewards for this role are dependent on the council passing these proposals in a timely fashion.
	- The Content Curator Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
- Storage Mint
	- The Storage Mint currently has a maximum value of 5 million tokens.
	- This mint has be refilled periodically
	- The Storage Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
