### 3.1 - Workflow, Performance, Challenged & Thinking
* @mmsaww   
	Hi, in my opinion the report is very informative, but for more transparency I would suggest adding information on the amounts spent from the treasury in section 2.1 "Proposals overview" along the lines of: SetWorkingGroupMintCapacity - mJOY   
	1.1 Content curators Mint: - mJOY   
	1.2. Storage providers Mint: - mJOY   
	1.3. Operation Mint: - mJOY   
	1.4. etc.      

	Spending - mJOY   
	2.1 Bounty #1: mJOY   
	2.2. Bounty #2 etc: mJOY   
	2.3. Others: mJOY   
	I think this system will allow genesis to give additional details about council's spending on bounty (to understand which bounties are in demand and which are not), also this details will perfectly complement standard tokenomics reporting (https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/tokenomics-reports/sumer-4/Council%20Round%20%2317%20-%20%231789200-%231890000%20-%20Tokenomics%20Report.md)

## 4 - Obligations
Council obligations are payments or items that carry through council sessions. These are noted so that future councils can easily see what items they should be aware of. Items can be removed from here once they have been resolved or become outdated.

### 4.1 Current Documents / Processes
- Council Report
    - Each council should produce a report which highlights important events, council participation, mint spending and other important facts surrounding the council term
- Council Budget
    - This is a proposal which tries to guide how many tokens the current council may have available to it during a term. This is a non binding proposal, so is mainly used as a guide for now.

### 4.2 Regular Payments / Proposals
- Council Mint
    - The council mint needs to be checked on a regular basis and in the event it is near depletion, a council member should notify a member of Jsgenesis in order for it to be refilled.
    - The council mint is set at a value decided by Jsgenesis.
- Council Roles
    - Council Secretary
        - This role was introduced in Council Round #18 and the payments are now managed by KPI rewards.
- Content Curator Mint
    - The Content Curator Mint currently has a maximum value of 5 million tokens.
    - The Content Curator Mint has to be filled periodically and the agreed amount was discussed earlier. The amount may change in the future, but the rewards for this role are dependent on the council passing these proposals in a timely fashion.
    - The Content Curator Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
- Storage Mint
    - The Storage Mint currently has a maximum value of 5 million tokens.
    - This mint has be refilled periodically
    - The Storage Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.

### 4.2 Bounties
