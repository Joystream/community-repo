JSON templates with questions: [SWGL](../roadmap/StorageLead.json) [DWGL](../roadmap/DistributorLead.json)

Once the proposal has been approved upon, all WG Leads must align the openings within two days. Each opening should include the following information:  

*   Description of the Working Group, with links to its Notion page and Discord channel.
*   Responsibilities. 
*   Required qualifications and skills. 
*   Monthly compensation (if separate compensation is discussed with each applicant, this should also be specified). 
*   Rules for termination.
