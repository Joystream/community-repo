Proposal: https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/222

## Rationale

The DAO needs to take responsibility for the different tools inherited during testnets or provided and maintained by JSG.

With the primary goal to establish teams and a transparent development processes the Council seeks to
- keep up to date via easy to read summary provided by BWGL bundling team updates.
- identify and focus high-value tasks that will improve usability.
- gain control over timelines and predictability of outcomes.

The long-term goal is for the DAO to be prepared to fill in for JSG to ensure that development goals are met and increase usefulness of Joystream tools to foster adoption.

## Process

1.  Team changes are tracked in a document on the community repo.
2.  BWGL maintains a tabular overview on the Joystream community repo with  
     - tool name and code repository link  
     - product manager  
     - DAO developers  
     - JSG developers
3.  Followed by a list of soecific development targets (milestones) with ETA and blockers for each.
4.  Updates to the document are submitted weekly via PR.
5.  The BWGL in coordination with the Council assigns hired Builders to product teams.
6.  The Council tasks the BWGL to assign builders for each tool to produce weekly updates and help to meet development goals.
7.  The base salary for each worker is defined by the BWGL in exchange for reading up on issue notifications, submitting reviews, analyzing user feedback and posting status udates in #daily-updates on Discord. Assignees are expected to submit an ETA per task and inform the BWGL immediately on availability changes in #builders.
8.  The Council communicates updates on targets (milestones) with intended release date via the Council Plan or Signal proposals and the BWGL is expected to adapt resource allocation. Milestones can be used to bundle multiple issues into releases with a list of "epics".
9.  Each team is expected to perform user tests to collect usability feedback on the forum and inform Council decisions. Relevant suggestions and bug reports should be lifted to the issue tracker. Test sprints and "quests" can be coordinated with MWG to set rules and distribute via known communication channels.
10.  The [heldesk](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/tree/master/archives/helpdesk) folder is to maintain a goto overview for new users and developers with an overview of available products and scripts.
