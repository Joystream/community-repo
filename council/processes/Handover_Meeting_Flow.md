Proposal: The following is a proposed flow for the handover meeting.

Meeting Schedule: Every 2nd day of the term, 11:00 CET (exception applies, more info here)
Meeting venue: Council voice channel in Discord or a stage channel (to be proposed)
Duration: 1 hour and 20-30 minutes 
Attendees: Former/Incoming CMs, Leads, Working Group (WG) members, and Community Members

## Rules and Guidelines:
1.  Attendees should join the council voice channel at least a minute early to ensure a timely start.
2.  Allotted periods for questions and discussion should be utilized, with attendees advised not to interrupt speakers unless urgent.
3.  To maintain efficiency, it is recommended to follow the schedule of events. The meeting host may interrupt speakers who have consumed all the allotted time, giving them up to 1 additional minute.
4.  The facilitator/host may mute attendees or take necessary actions to avoid disturbances during the meeting.
5.  It is recommended that all members, especially new CMs, read the report of previous council members before the handover. This will enable a more in-depth and interactive discussion, making the meetings more efficient.
