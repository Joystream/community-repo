# Reporting Cycle

## Overview
The Joystream DAO is a complex organisation that performs a multitude of tasks and generates a substantial volume of information. In order to accurately assess the performance of the system, the Council must undertake an evaluation to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

This guide provides reporting procedures and associated templates which will assist the Council in this evaluation process. The templates provided in this guide will facilitate the production of WG reports.

## Reporting schedule
For the sake of convenience, we assume that 1 day period is equal to 14400 blocks. For instance, when we refer to 1 day period, it means 14400 blocks; when we refer to 2 days period, it means 28800 blocks, and so on.

Item |	Period | Reports
--|--|--
1 | Term start → Term start + 12 hours		| Working Group Reports
2 | Term start → Term start + 1 day		| Council Report
3 | Term start + 1day → Term start + 2 days	| Council Plan
4 | Term start + 2day → Term start + 3 days	| Working Group Plans

* The members of the Council from the previous term are to be tasked with delivering a report on the 1st day of the Council period.

## Reporting Templates
Working Group Leaders and Council members are to adhere to the template provided below:

- [WG Term Plan Template](../templates/WG_Plan.md)
- [WG Term Report Template](../templates/WG_Report.md)
- [Council Term Plan Template](../templates/Council_Plan.md)
- [Council Term Report Template](../templates/Council_Report.md)

## Reporting space
- The Plans and Reports of the respective Working Groups should be deposited in the Working Group's designated category on the Pioneer.
- The Plans and Reports of the Council should be deposited in the Council's designated category on the Pioneer.
- Once any of the reports have been generated - WG Term Report, WG Term Report Plan, Council Term Report, Council Term Plan - they should also be posted in the #council channel on Discord.

## Process management
- If the Working Group Plans or Reports are not completed by the due date, Council may impose a salary deduction of up to three days or until the report is completed for the Lead responsible. This should be noted in the Council Report.
- Should a Lead inform the Report/Plans team of a delay in advance, a maximum of one day's postponement will be granted. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, the Lead should not be held responsible for any delays.
- If the Council Plan or Report are not completed by by the due date,  information regarding Council Plan incident should be included in the subsequent Council Report, and any incidents related to the current Council Report should be addressed in the next Council Report.
