## 3 - Review
### 3.1 - Workflow
@tomato
During this council round, the proposal discussion system was activated which makes the council's processes a lot more streamlined. Most of the workflow for now involves trying to create a discussion regarding proposals and then finally creating proposals and trying to get the council to vote in a timely fashion.
@freakstatic
I also agree that this round was bit difficult to get most of the members contribute to the council, right from the start it took a bit to gather the 10 participants required to fill the council seats. Maybe in the future the number of seats can be reduce in order to include only interested/active members but is a bit too soon to decide.
@fierydev
Hi, not much feedback for this round, from what I can understand, the council has been quite actively trying to figure out the next set of KPI's and how to full fill them! Meaningful ideas are being exchanged by many learned members and progress is being made.
### 3.2 - Challenges & Thinking
@tomato
For this round of the council it was very difficult to get the majority of the council to vote on proposals in a timely fashion, however no proposals failed due to a lack of votes, but it could still be improved. This was probably due to the poor turnout (10 applicants for 10 seats) for the previous election and perhaps newer members of the council are not fully aware of the council's role on the platform. Besides activity of members some of the KPIs were difficult to achieve within the timeframes expected.
@freakstatic
The number of validators have been a bit low lately... Maybe we should increase the reward or decrease the available slots.
### 3.3 - Performance
@tomato
Overall the council did well this round in creating proposals and communicating across various mediums (forum & Telegram chat). Unfortunately we missed some KPIs this session due to various reasons.
@fierydev
Sufficient votes for deciding proposals are being made in a not so timely manner, however I feel that the new Council will be doing a better job this week!

## 4 - Obligations
Council obligations are payments or items that carry through council sessions. These are noted so that future councils can easily see what items they should be aware of. Items can be removed from here once they have been resolved or become outdated.
### 4.1 Regular Payments / Proposals
- Council Mint
	- The council mint needs to be checked on a regular basis and in the event it is near depletion, a council member should notify a member of Jsgenesis in order for it to be refilled.
	- The council mint is set at a value decided by Jsgenesis.
- Content Curator Mint
	- The Content Curator Mint currently has a maximum value of 1 million tokens.
	- The Content Curator Mint has to be filled periodically and the agreed amount was discussed earlier. The amount may change in the future, but the rewards for this role are dependent on the council passing these proposals in a timely fashion.
	- The Content Curator Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
### 4.2 Bounties
- Forum Telegram Bot Bounty ($60)
	- This was already coded and implemented but the author has not yet created a spending propsal to collect their reward. The author should commit the code to Joystream community repo when they are ready to collect the reward. (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/33)
