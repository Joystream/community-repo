**Council #0 **
Block range: 
\[995611-1096410\]

**Workflow**

We tried to discuss what should be included in the Storage proposal using the forum
https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/32/page/1 and we were able to agree on something in order to create the proposal.

**Challenges** 

Was the first time for everyone, so understanding what were the responsibilities of the council since everything was a bit new.

Create bounties since nothing make sures that a person will do what we ask for, for example, for the proposal "We need more cartoons on Joystream".

The difference of timezones of the council members.


**Thinking** 

This session was a bit about exploring and choosing a good number of storage providers.


**Performance**

We have created 3 proposals:
