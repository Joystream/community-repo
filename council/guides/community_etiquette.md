## Joystream Ecosystem values

* **Transparency** - unless otherwise limited by law, contract or morality, all the decisions and work should be open for the community to see and participate in.
* **Growth mindset** - we are continually learning, thriving on challenge, see failure as a way to learn and improve (not an evidence of lack of ability)
* **Pragmatism** - instead of focusing on the ideal solution, focus on solutions that drive value for ecosystem stakeholders
* **Ecosystem first** - regardless of where we each officially work, everything we do should put the ecosystem ahead of ourselves or a particular company. Don’t try to do everything yourself - engage people around you in community and bring new people.
* **Ease of Use** - we believe that open technologies will only succeed if they are easy to adopt and use.

## Joystream Communication Etiquette

* Be positive and welcoming to everyone in ecosystem. Not everyone will be, but you should project these values and attract more people who are positive.
* Never escalate conflict - conflict is not a growing mindset, conflict only appears when you think that everything that happen is fixed and nothing can be changed.
* Don’t be defensive. Don’t push back. It doesn’t show growth mindset.
* If you do see conflict or people being defensive - de-escalate it. Suggest ways how people can communicate better and grow together. Improve the mood in the room, don’t bring gloom.
* Trolling and attacking individual people is not the right way to maintain the conversation. The trolling, attacks or things that don’t make any sense don’t warrant a response - be pragmatic. See if there are real concerns and address them.
* Asking for more transparency is totally appropriate, as it pushes for better processes and accountability. 
* It’s also totally fine to admit that the current process is not optimal, that some things are not yet working. Showcasing what results were achieved is important and it’s important to highlight what was learned as well.
* It’s important to be pragmatic and showcase pragmatism to others - sometimes there is no ideal solution but some things just need to be done. Example: promoting a global crypto project is a hard problem with no playbook that works. Trying practical things, learning from them, and continue to iterate to improve results.
