    - Deadline: 12h (around 7200 blocks) after the scores publication, which can vary, but the leads should start to work on the plan as soon as the council is elected.
- [Summary](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring#council-period-summary)
    - Template: TBD
    - Deadline: On the last friday 23:59 CET of the council term

The reports need to follow the template provided by the council. Additional information can be included in the end of the report. 

## Submission
As described in the [Scoring Period Scoring](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/general-working-group-score#submission) document, the lead's need to post their reports in the forum, in each working group category.   
The council needs to create a proposal to approve the reports of the working groups. This can be done by a single proposal or by multiple ones.
