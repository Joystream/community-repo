## Storage WG Tasks

1. What is the storage capacity of each individual server now?
2. Is it possible to show how much bandwidth each server has consumed over the past week or month? If there are no tools installed for this currently, it may be possible to get this information from the server host (ex. Vultr shows the bandwidth use of each server on a daily basis going back a month)
3. What are the approximate costs of each server, and do the current worker payments cover these?


## Curator WG Tasks

1. Hire 2 curator workers during the council session, preferably at least one bilingual curator as we have a lot of Russian language content that has to be reviewed. Make sure the openings for these have clear deadlines as we have a backlog of uncurated videos.
2. Once hired, post a thread on the forums indicating the language/timezone of the curation team
3. Since it is assumed there are many uncurated videos, prioritize getting outstanding videos curated.
4. Create a thread and complete one regular check as defined here: https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk/tree/master/roles/content-curators#regular-checks. Since no check has been performed before this could include the videos uploaded since the last curation work was performed.
5. Post on the forums or create a proposal with a basic breakdown of the status of the working group, this should include a status of uncurated videos at the end of the council session.
