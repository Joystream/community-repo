## KPI.23-27 Council Term Summary Video Reviews

### What is good? 

The video was created solely for parsing the specific timing of the advice.
In particular, the participants who were elected to the council are highlighted.
Economy and pool replenishment.
New proposals or some non-standard voting by the consuls or Jsgenesis.


### What is not good? What would you like them to include, but is missing?

The video clearly lacked:
* Constructive criticism,
* Ideas, wishes for improving the project or other issues.
* Expressions about what is happening within the community.

## Output:

After analyzing these videos in the period from 23 to 27 of the council's term, there was no live communication, which, in my opinion, is a problem for our platform, since the goal is one, and the participants do not know each other at all.
In the future, this could bring negative consequences.

## KPI.28-32 - Council Term Summary Video Reviews

### What is good? 

During this period, changes were made for this KPI.
The videos were recorded as more live communication (rather than screen recording).
The idea is interesting because:
* There is criticism, which is quite adequate from the participants. The opinions of the participants were expressed, which can be taken into account and corrected. Since the project is at the test stage, this is important.
* There is also the discussion of the participants that they like, there are questions to Jsgenesis, which are also interesting for them to answer.

### What is not good? 

I think it lacks a little bit of uncertainty from the faces that are filmed in these videos.
I want to note that this is a human factor, and so it may be, but I am bringing to the point that I would introduce certain persons to perform these tasks, so that they would clarify ordinary moments that may be incomprehensible to many!

### What would you like them to include, but is missing?

There remains a lack of live communication. I would like to see these podcasts as two-person phoning explaining something about the platform (not slicing the video).
Also presentability and a good example of some kind of questions.
So that the person who watches the video is clearly aware of his topic and understands what is at stake.
Since it is difficult for a beginner to grasp what already experienced project participants are talking about, I would introduce just such a method of introducing a podcast.
The introduction of uptime by video is lacking, so that a person will come in and choose a topic that interests him.
And finally, to make the background of our project, supposedly I provide from whom exactly these community faces are speaking (:

## Output:
In general, the videos are created interesting to watch, but still there is not enough live communication (phoning).
The introduction of uptime has made it more informative and easier to view.
