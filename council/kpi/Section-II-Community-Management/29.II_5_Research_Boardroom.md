## KPI 29.II-5 - Research Boardroom

Purpose [Boardroom](https://app.boardroom.info/) is a website that showcases the governance side of a selection of DAO projects. Some of the projects put out a weekly update which is included in a newsletter, as well as contribute to a calendar which lists updates and proposals from projects. It would be interesting to know how Joystream could integrate with Boardroom.

### Scope of Work

#### Investigate Boardroom and write a report showing whether it is possible for Joystream to integrate with it.

> I did a research on social media, documentation and support discord.
Based on the data received, the conclusion is this: platform [Boardroom](https://app.boardroom.info/)
Doesn't support Polkadot (Substrate)

1. This must include what the process and/or requirements to be featured on the site

> Integrations: [Link](https://docs.boardroom.info/adding-your-project/getting-started)

2. If there is an application process, and how this looks like

> Adding Your Project: [Link](https://docs.boardroom.info/adding-your-project/adding-your-project)

3. Whether the Community can maintain this

> No

4. Any other any other relevant information, as well as Joystream's blockchain compatibility with the project.

> We are not conscientious, basically all projects on the platform are based on ETH

#### Are there any other Polkadot or Substrate based projects currently included on Boardroom? If yes, what are they?

> As I wrote above, it does not support Polkadot or Substrate

#### Are there any similar websites/platforms to Boardroom where the Joystream project could possibly be listed? These sites should similarly show proposals, newsletters and some governance information from the Joystream project alongside other projects.

> Extensive research showed that with such functionality as in [Boardroom](https://app.boardroom.info/)
Extensive research has shown that with functionality such as "displaying offers, newsletters and some management information" 
There are no such platforms anymore. Ps. 
There is a similar project, but I think it is too weak a version. [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/)

There is an interesting note, it looks like this project supports many networks. Including Moondeam.
