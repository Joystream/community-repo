as for the reasons of firing, there is no information about it in the reports. but i asked current lead about it. his answer: “the reason was simply that i got no response and thought they are no longer interested. everyone who got fired can message me and will create a new opening.”

## 3. What was the overall spending (in both tJOY and USD) at the start of every Council Term starting from the week before the Lead was hired, until now?

i can’t grade overall spending in OWG before hiring a current lead just because he was the first member of the group and the only lead of this group. so all spending were under the direction of the current lead.

## 4. Is the Operations handling their "basic" workload as defined in the helpdesk repo?

i think yes. lead answered me that the main focus of the group now - to improve jsstats and the bots we use, among other things. he also asked me if weekly reports should contain information about workers activities. i said yes! 

now it’s difficult to see operations work and understand what they are doing. but including such information in weekly report will make group work more visible. 

i also believe that this group is very important and powerful, but they need to do something with the budget. he is too low, but council members don’t see it: they only see that OWG is the most expensive group and may think that they should reduce their budget. but the true is that this group makes a lot for the project. yes, it needs lots of money because there are good developers. so my goal for now - to create some system which will help to make their work clear for others.
