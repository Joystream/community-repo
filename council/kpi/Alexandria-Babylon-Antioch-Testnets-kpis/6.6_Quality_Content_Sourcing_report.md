## KPI 06.6 - Quality Content Sourcing

Part of this KPI was to produce a report outlining some potential ways of sourcing some quality content for Joystream. A forum thread was opened and this report contains some of the comments left by users: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/160

	* I think that in order to achieve more content, with good quality, a system to reward content creators must be created. Like for uploading a video you earn X tokens and for 100 views you earn +Y tokens. The reward for views must be higher that the reward for uploads to ensure that good quality videos are being uploaded.

	### For public domain / CC media
	1. Identify as many sources as possible. We can create a bounty for this, or allow users to create spending proposals. I'm not sure of the best way to have a list that is maintained, but maybe this is something we can do with the community repo and allow rewards for user who update this master list, that way the list can be maintained and built into the future and not just be used temporarily.

	2. Identify some interesting categories of content based on what Atlas has now. So for Film & Animation as a category, we could have a bounty to upload 5 public domain videos covering this category. I think it would be better to target many small jobs in this way instead of having a very large job so we can involve more people. It would also help to have this as a smaller focused bounty so that there is a more consistent flow of uploads rather than far too many.

	#### For individual creators
	1. Build a base level program for creators to sign up for that provides rewards. We could pay per viewcount, or per video (get paid for your first 3 uploads) or both. We should probably try to offer incentives for people who sign up creators to Joystream (a simple referral system).

	2. We'd also need to identify a budget to be used for this. The management and structure of such a reward system would obviously be very important and we would need to devise a way of choosing interesting creators who are worth rewarding.

	#### Competitions
	Another interesting idea would be to have a weekly competition for a particular video subject and to reward "correct" entries with some amount on a first come, first serve basis. I think competitions are a very important thing to consider, but we would need to fully flesh out such a system to make it fair and fun for participants. This may not be particularly feasible until we have a sufficient number of content creators engaged on Telegram and other places.

	This could also be done in conjunction with the public domain videos, and having several competitions active at once. Some focusing on public domain and others focusing on user generated content.

	#### Budgets
	One interesting way of making sourcing content work would be to have a revolving budget each council session, for example $50 (as part of the weekly replenishment). Then have a KPI to incentivize the council to "use" these funds well (either for building lists of sources, or for rewarding users for uploading good content that falls within what is expected).
