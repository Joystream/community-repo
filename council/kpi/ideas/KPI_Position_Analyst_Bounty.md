# Position: Analyst Bounty

### Problem:
- Repeated cases of delayed payment of funds to the Bounty participants, which were more connected due to a misunderstanding of the responsible persons. There have been cases of detentions of awards up to 3 weeks.
- Difficulty in understanding the statistics of awards for the community.

### Purpose:
It is necessary to introduce the proposed position, appoint a responsible person from among the consuls with the appropriate skills. Key skills for accepting a consul:

- At least 5 working terms in the council.
- Experience with github.

### Scope of work:
- Creation of a channel branch discord / forum #analytic_channel for displaying and transmitting all the necessary information, as well as creating a separate wallet for future payments. The information will be forwarded to the person in charge.

- Confirmation of the fixed rate of payments from "BM" for the payment of awards to the participants of the "Bounty", as well as the transfer of the table with the assessment so that the Analyst has the opportunity to analyze and compare with previous terms.This can help in an inflationary situation.

- Placing information in the "PR document" and creating a "Proposal" for approval by the consuls. The specified document on the vote is completely correct if it is correctly drawn up in accordance with the steps indicated above and the statistics in it are correct.

- Compilation of infographics on the current Bounty how payments vary from previous dates.

- Requesting coins in accordance with the statistics of the document for a separately created wallet for payments to participants.

- Payment of funds by Bounty participants.

### Deadline:
Since the work of the Bounty Analyst is directly related to the work of BM, I propose to set the time for submitting information to BM until Saturday. Thus, the consul will have 4 days to perform these duties.

__Output:__

~~This position will allow not only to remove cases of delay in payments, but also to collect statistics necessary to help maintain inflation.~~
