## KPI Support for new members
On the JoyStream platform, most of the activities are related to the work on KPIs created for consuls. There is a natural problem of increasing stake for consul elections due to the accumulation of coins by experienced community members. Thus, it is getting more and more difficult for new members of community to become a consul.
### Purpose
It is necessary to ensure the passage of active newcomers to the consuls in a rough one-to-one proportion with experienced members of the community. The task is complicated by the necessity of working together with experienced community members who used a large amount of tokens to get to the council and may not be available for dialogue.
### Scope of work
Securing admission to the council for new consuls can be achieved by the following steps:
- Keep records of consuls for the last 5 terms of the council.
- Identify new active participants, describe when they came to the project, how many times they were in the consuls, their activity and the opportunity to be online. Consider newcomers who have been consul less than three times.
- Organize a crowdfunding campaign to collect a stake for new consular candidates.
- Agree with the majority of experienced consuls, who are planning to participate in the current elections, on the maximum initial stake, and vote for themselves.
- Report on the crowdfunding campaign, distributing the contribution of the rest of the participants in percentage terms, including the contribution of experienced consuls (if any).

### Distribution of rewards
It is impossible to calculate the reward in advance, as it will depend on:
- Number of active newbies
- Activity of other participants in making a stake for beginners
- Behavior of experienced consuls
 
So:
- If there are more than a third of newcomers to the council, then the organizer (or several) receives $100. 
$100 is distributed between the crowdfunding participants (if there are participants)
- If half or most of the newcomers are included in the council, then the organizer (or several) receives $150. 
$150 is distributed between the crowdfunding participants (if there are participants)

### Report
In a summary, provide a link to a description of the crowdfunding campaign, surveys, descriptions of all participants (in your opinion), whether the reward should be distributed among one or more other marketing managers.
