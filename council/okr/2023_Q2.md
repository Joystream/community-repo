## OKR Process

For the 2nd quarter, due to time constraints and since this will be the first for the DAO to make OKRs it is suggested to come up with a simple one. Although, step-by-step progress should be documented preferably by the Council Secretary/Membership Lead in order to make a proper OKR Process for the 3rd Quarter that is suitable and efficient for the DAO.

Based on the set of OKRs above, the next step if this proposal will get approval is to be disseminated to the leads preferably through a call and eventually to the community.

### **Initial Process**

During the first term of the 2nd quarter, the leads should come up with a set of OKRs on their plans based on the Objectives, Key Results, and initiatives examples from the OKRs mentioned in this signal proposal. Each working group is expected to come up with its own set of OKRs and initiatives based on the DAO OKRs.

*Example (Please refer to the Miro link on the rationale for a better understanding.)  
HR Objective: **Provide necessary help to the community in making on-chain membership**  
A table should appear on the WGs plan named: OKRs  
The objective should be something that can be achieved for a particular term that is aligned with the Key Initiatives prepared by the council. From what's written above an OKR set could be like below:  
O 8th term: HR WG is aware of the whole process of making an on-chain membership.  
KR 8th term: 20% increase in on-chain membership from the previous term.  
Initiatives:  
Conduct a meeting with Membership Lead and the workers  
Assure all the HR workers are aware of how to make on-chain membership and other related info about membership to be able to give support to newcomers.*

### **Evaluation**

To evaluate OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) traditional grading scale will be applied. The percentage of completion or progress made for each objective will be mapped against the traditional grading scale.

**DAO-wide OKRs**

Each key result will be graded a score on a scale between **0** and **1.0**, with 0 representing a failed or never started item, and 0.8 to 1.0 representing successful completion. A score below 0.6 is poor, and 0.6 to 0.79 is acceptable. The scores of each key result contribute to an approximate average for the OKR score. The final grades will be assigned at the end of Q2 2023.

**WG-level OKRs**

At the end of each term in the 2nd quarter, the OKRs made by the WG leads are to be evaluated using the same scoring as the DAO-wideâ€™s on a scale of 0 to 1 (being the highest). The average of the term evaluations is to be determined at the end of the quarter.
