# How to Build a Discord Bot 

This document is written in response to the first question of request for [Joystream's](joystream.org) Bounty [13](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/123)

## Getting Started

Go to Discord's [bot portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and create a new application, giving it an appropriate name.

 Copy and save the Client ID and secret (where the 2 arrows are pointing at), making sure you keep the secret secret.

So far, what you have is a simple application.

You click on the Bot tab under settings to your left, and click on the "add a bot button".

This would take you to your bot homepage. You'll be given a token, which you should take note off and keep safe.

As an aside, never store any keys or tokens on GitHub, ESPECIALLY if the repo is public.


## Developing the Bot

This is not part of my scope. It would be completed by whoever takes on step 2 of the bounty

## Deploying the Bot
This is also for whomever takes step three of the bounty.
