# Storage Working Group Status Reporting - 35

## Storage Lead : _0x2bc_

### Report:

This is the 35th report for the Storage Provider Working Group. 

* All buckets (714-930) are stored at 3 different buckets/SP nodes. JSGenesis node is not taken into account 

* 8/9 storage operators upgraded their nodes (@godshunter is re-installing his node now)

* All new bags/channels are replicated to 3 SP nodes

* We still has an issue with usage of locally installed Query Nodes. It prevents the full launch of all SP nodes. @freakstatic has found out three workarounds. The final approval on which workaround to use is required from JSGenesis team .

* We got a new issue with failed uploads to some SPs, still working on it.
