## Council Status
Before we talk about the status of the working groups its important to note also the status of the council and platform in general:
* The Council has only agreed on a reporting system for the Storage working group, the council hasn't agreed on one for the Curator working group so far.
* There has been a huge number of new users making communication with the working groups less than ideal
* We've recently transitioned from Telegram to Discord so communication has not been ideal
* We've had a significant number of uploads in a short amount of time due to so many new users and there aren't really any processes we've developed so far to deal with this level of activity.

## Storage Working Group Status
The current status of this working group:
* The lead is responsive on the forums / chat (although was unresponsive for a bit)
* The lead had been following the reporting requirements reasonably well
* All of the storage providers seem to have enough storage capacity to host the content directory as it currently stands (108 GB). I've created a thread to ask about this and point out how to access the size information from https://status.joystream.org/status : https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/299
* The workers are being paid and their storage providers are up
* There appear to be sufficient workers hired for this role and the maximum allowed for by the budget, no requests have been made to increase this number yet.

## Curator Working Group Status
The current status of this working group:
* The lead is responsive on the forums / chat
* The lead has been having issues with the CLI (it has had to be reinstalled and is taking time to reinstall)
* The only curator worker has quit
* There was one worker, however a budget was approved for two workers.
* There is no clear reporting system in place and since there is no reporting system in place we can't identify how many videos require curation.
* There is evidently a backlog of videos requiring curation that are affecting new users of the platform. It is unclear how big the backlog of videos is and Atlas shows the last video uploaded as being from 3 days ago.
* It is unclear what tools (besides just the CLI) are available or need to be created to allow for effective reporting for this role.
