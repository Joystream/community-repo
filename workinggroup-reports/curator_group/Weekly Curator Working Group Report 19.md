* This report will include very detailed data on the work of each curator and all the work of the curator group.

`Notes: I have repeatedly informed the entire group of curators what the curators need to do and that the lead curator 
should be aware of the work done in time. But not all curators do this.`

* Curator IgreX - this reporting week, he was active 1 time, he said that he would watch incoming videos, at the moment 
I have no information that he did anything this week. He did not provide the curator with anything about what he was doing.

* Curator lyazufey1812 - She did not show any activity, only asked when she would receive a reward for her work. 
That's all she did this week based on the data I have at the moment.

* Curator mmsaww - He was active, asked what he should do, I asked to check the incoming videos, but he said that he did not 
know how to use hydra, and said that he needed time to learn how to do it, I gave him instructions on hydra on gitub.

* Curator kadyrovs - I repeatedly wrote to the lead curator that he was ready to work and what tasks he could do, 
I asked him to check 10 incoming videos, he did his job and provided the lead curator with all the detailed information on time.

* Curator kiraa -  He is constantly active, an excellent curator, completes all tasks on time and reports this to the lead curator. 
One of the best curators, I watched 10 videos on my assignment and provided a report on this.

* Curator zazik - In addition to my task to view 10 incoming videos (task completed), he did a lot of other work, he re-checked the bounty table 18 (102 videos) in 1 day and provided a report. He does more every day than I ask him to.

Leader among curators this week.

* Curator leet_joy - No activity

According to data provided by some of the curators, and verified by me personally through hydra - 
it gives such information that during this reporting period 50 videos were uploaded. All videos are checked and identified.

`Found 12 duplicates and 3 license mismatches.` 

Based on the data I have:

Curated by zazik - checked 10 videos.

Curated by kiraa - checked 10 videos.

Curated by kadyrovs - checked 10 videos.

Curator Lead Laura reviewed 20 videos.

I also checked all 50 videos again.

`Lead curator's opinion: not all curators work, this creates big problems in the effectiveness of the curator's group. 
A more effective tool is needed to remove non-working or ineffective curators.`
