* This report will include very detailed data on the work of each curator and all the work of the curator group.

`Notes: I have repeatedly informed the entire group of curators what the curators need to do and that the lead curator 
should be aware of the work done in time. But not all curators do this.`

* Curator IgreX - this reporting week, he was active 1 time, he said that he would watch incoming videos, at the moment 
I have no information that he did anything this week. He did not provide the curator with anything about what he was doing.

* Curator lyazufey1812 - She did not show any activity, only asked when she would receive a reward for her work. 
That's all she did this week based on the data I have at the moment.

* Curator mmsaww - He was active, asked what he should do, I asked to check the incoming videos, but he said that he did not 
know how to use hydra, and said that he needed time to learn how to do it, I gave him instructions on hydra on gitub.

* Curator kadyrovs - I repeatedly wrote to the lead curator that he was ready to work and what tasks he could do, 
I asked him to check 10 incoming videos, he did his job and provided the lead curator with all the detailed information on time.

* Curator kiraa -  He is constantly active, an excellent curator, completes all tasks on time and reports this to the lead curator. 
One of the best curators, I watched 10 videos on my assignment and provided a report on this.

* Curator zazik - In addition to my task to view 10 incoming videos (task completed), he did a lot of other work, he re-checked the bounty table 18 (102 videos) in 1 day and provided a report. He does more every day than I ask him to.

Leader among curators this week.

* Curator leet_joy - No activity 

# This is the third lead curator report in two days.

* It is the responsibility of the lead curator to submit a report once a week, link to the rules https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/rules/Content_Curator_WG_Lead-Tasks_Reporting_Requirements.md

* Yesterday I submitted a report 2 times, they were not approved because 2 curators were outraged by the assessment of their effectiveness (they are also acting consuls), and they were also not happy that the lead curator did not take into account their work. But, before submitting the report, the curators did not provide me with any information about their work done (therefore, their work is not in this report)


* After canceling two reports yesterday, I spoke with these two curators in the curator group. They gave me a table with the work done for a week, a link to the table https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LMYztVNw6za31H5OZBA8zX8OEv09fqDSUnkRYYacDYU/edit#gid=0

Having looked at the results of the work done by the curators, I come to the conclusion that the curators do not understand the importance of checking the original licenses. There are no licenses indicated in the table, this is probably a problem, since bounty 10 was previously stopped due to the same checks. JS also repeatedly drew our attention to this.

As a lead curator, I declare that such work undermines our previous work (for example, the bounty table 10) if the incoming videos are checked in the same way, it is likely that we will have another table and punishment (as was the case with the bounty table 10)

JS has mentioned many times that it is important to check the validity of licenses.

Below I provide a link to the table of the rest of the group and the lead with verified licenses: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fMtGsd7oDcU9N_ylZ8ilIM-nLhaiWgH2/edit#gid=1211962092

According to data provided by some of the curators, and verified by me personally through hydra - 
it gives such information that during this reporting period 50 videos were uploaded. All videos are checked and identified.

Found 12 duplicates and 3 license mismatches. 

Based on the data I have:

Curated by zazik - checked 10 videos.

Curated by kiraa - checked 10 videos.

Curated by kadyrovs - checked 10 videos.

Curator Lead Laura reviewed 20 videos.

I also checked all 50 videos again.

`Lead curator's opinion: not all curators work, this creates big problems in the effectiveness of the curator's group. 
A more effective tool is needed to remove non-working or ineffective curators.`
