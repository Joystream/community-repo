### Compare with [Helpdesk](https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk/tree/master/roles/content-curators)

Curator Lead

1. During his term `Igrex` hire and fire workers, was active on Discord, changed workers reward, changed featured videos
2. Replenished Content Working Group Mint
3. Had big delays in bounty 18. BM not answered many days
4. Assigned BM for Bounty 10 and 16 (BM for Bounty 10 is not a curator worker)

Curator Workers

1. Checked all upload videos and create a [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LMYztVNw6za31H5OZBA8zX8OEv09fqDSUnkRYYacDYU/edit#gid=0)
2. Found all [duplicates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LMYztVNw6za31H5OZBA8zX8OEv09fqDSUnkRYYacDYU/edit#gid=2048884930)
3. Warn videos in forum [thread](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/329)
4. Censored 8 videos
5. Video licenses were not checked, which led to the closure of Bounty 10

Content Curator WG usually just watch the uploaded videos. If the video without thubnails or does not play, the curators leave a message on the forum and in the table. Bounty 10 checked by Ruslan#4019 (not curator worker). Bounty 18 - was a big delay.

### Performance for the Lead

At least 70% of the work he did

### Performance for the Workers

- `leet_joy` < 30% (checked few videos, does not appear on Discord)

- `meskalin` < 30% (checked few videos, does not appear on Discord)

- `prontera` around 50%

- `lyazufey1812` 100% (super active person)

- `kiraa` 50% (was active, BM for Bounty 18. But now does not answer many days)

- `mmsaww` 100% (active person, now BM for Bounty 16)

### Suggestion for the path forward

According to [WG Lead Term Limits](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/rules/WG_Lead_Term_Limits.md) Lead's term soon ends. 

There is a proposal to leave `Igrex` as content curator. He had a good time. But we need to make way for new candidates
