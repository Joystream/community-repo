As part of the recent KPIs (https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-kpis/#10.7, https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-kpis/#10.8, https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-kpis/#10.9) the council is required to come up with conditions under which a lead can be fired and/or slashed.

## WARN/SLASH/FIRE rules

1. The warning is given after approved text proposal. The warning can be issued by anyone

- If the Lead goes AFK with no prior explanation for 4 days he can be warned.
- If the Lead isn't responsive for further 2 days after approved warn-proposal, council could slash 25% of funds. 
- If the Lead isn't responsive for a further 1 day after approved slash-proposal, then council could fire them. It is up to the person making the firing proposal on whether or not to fully slash the lead's funds.
- If the Lead fails to produce 2 (two) reports they should be warned.
- If the Lead fail to produce 3 (three) reports in a row they can be fired. It is up to the person making the firing proposal on whether or not to fully slash the lead's funds.
- Any malicious/fraudulent activity = firing + slashing

## Allowances for New Leads, Upgrades and high workloads

*rules for a probationary period*

- During the probationary period, the council gives a little more flexibility so that they can deal with what is required before considering serious action.
- After upgrades or high workloads, you should probably expect some reports and things to be delayed, if the presenter provides a reasonable explanation and is even sociable, then some element of leniency should be provided.

### When proposals are made for warning, slashing or firing a lead, they should include relevant information and links to communicate what the issue is clearly.

If anyone has doubts when choosing the type of proposal, feel free to ask the secretary of the council or deputy
