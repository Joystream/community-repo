# Overview

The Joystream Community Repo is a resource by the Joystream community with [archived testnet content](archives) by founding members.

Although the community controls the repo, Jsgenesis has final say to approve and merge pull requests with code. The content is licensed under [GPLv3](/LICENSE). Community members with merge permission are @mochet and @traumschule.

The workflow for changing the repo depends on the reason and purpose behind the change.
A consistent part is for the contributor to fork the repo, and create a pull request to the applicable branch.
All changes need to be approved with a proposal. For details see the [testnet workflow](archives).
