# Community Wishlist
The Community Wishlist is a list of ideas, features or changes that are submitted by the Joystream community. Ideas are added to the list based on the council's vote, and contributors are rewarded with tokens for their idea. These are not proposals to fund actual development of ideas, it is simply created a list of ideas that would be nice to have!

## Details
* Current reward: 250k Tokens per approved idea
* Current limit: 7 approved ideas per council session. Each idea is considered by the block it was created on, not when it is approved. Council session information can be found [here](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/council)

### What is a good idea?
* Ideas should be relevant to Joystream as a platform, but they can cover things like features that you feel are missing. They could also involve the creation of things to help members of the community, like instructions, competitions, chat bots or scripts.

### What is not a good idea?
* Anything that is covered by other proposals types (how much a storage provider gets paid, or how many council members there should be).
* Things like fixing bugs and errors are not for here, they should be submitted to appropriate channels like the forum or the helpdesk on Github.

### Instructions to contribute an idea
* [Create a spending proposal](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/new/spending)
* Write the title as "CW:" and fill in a very short description of your idea, please use CW: so that it is easy to see that it is for the community wishlist!
* Write the basic idea in the rationale field
* Set the amount of tokens as 250k
* Select the destination account as your own key (or put in another key if you feel like rewarding a friend)
* Click Submit.
* Create a forum post sharing your proposal and also feel free to share it to gather interest!
* The council will now vote on your proposed idea, they currently have 72,000 blocks to vote, which is about 5 days.

### Submission requirements
* The idea must not be a duplicate
* The title of the idea must include "CW: " followed by the idea
* The number of tokens must be what is the currently agreed amount
* The rationale should include a good description of what the idea is
* The idea must not be a duplicate, inappropriate or cover aspects which are described in "What is not a good idea"

### Rules & Terms
* Any idea you submit is considered to be under the applicable license of the community repo at the time of submission, this is currently GPL-3.0 https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/LICENSE
* Duplicate and very similar wishlist ideas should be rejected by the council
* Ideas are considered by the block on which they are submitted, not the block on which they are approved.
* Ideas which do not conform by the submission instructions (title, reward amount) can be rejected or slashed by the council.
* There is no guarantee that any feature will be added, nor a timeframe for features to be added this is just a wishlist.
* First come, first serve. The first time an idea is submitted & approved by the council, it can be added to the list.
* Further rules/terms can be added or changed via a council voted [text proposal](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/new/text). Reward amount, applicant limitations and other aspects are all subject to change based on council decisions.
