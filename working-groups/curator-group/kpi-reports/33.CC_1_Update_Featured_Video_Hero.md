`Based on part 1 of this KPI , videos what are above. We must to choose 2 - 3 alternatives videos for Jsgenesis , then we'll create .JSON`

### 3. The logical and correct solution would be to make the main cover video once every two days, it turns out the required number of videos is 15 pieces. To replace it, you need to take 5 additional videos in stock, in total, for just 1 month, you need to select 20 video files of high-quality wide format with the possibility of some repetition.

### 4. The person who will do this must follow a number of specific requirements:

1 - Select video files for the Banner in accordance with the requirements:
- Widescreen video mode (horizontal is prohibited)
- Excellent video quality of at least 720p 
- High-quality sound 
- License (source clearly showing that the video is properly licensed)
- Without Censored
- Duration of more than 30 seconds
*the number of 20 pieces (15 main + 5 spare)

2 - A discussion is compiled with a list of video files, discussed and then approved by the Council of consuls for crawling.

3 - The list approved by the Council of Consuls is processed into a Json file and sent for final confirmation by Jsgenesis.
