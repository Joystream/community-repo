During this reporting period, 180 videos were uploaded, all of them verified.

Everything is optimized, each curator does their job perfectly! Thank you all for your work!)

Bounty 18 and Bounty 24 are working properly and are being checked, bounty managers are appointed (they are not working curators)

For convenience and statistics collection, general tables for Bounty 24 and Bounty 18 have been added.

An offer has been made to dismiss me :)

I want to say thank you to the curators for the excellent work! Great guys.
