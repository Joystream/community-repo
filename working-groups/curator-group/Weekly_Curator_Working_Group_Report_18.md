37 new videos were added during the week. All videos are verified. Basically, all the big work this week has been filling out and submitting the Bounty 10 table, the table is ready and submitted.

4191 videos have been reviewed and completed. @ IgreX I was often absent on personal offline matters. Otherwise, everything is fine in the team of curators.
