Since there was a constant problem with checking licenses. The lead curator this week set the task for all curators to check the video for August, the curators exceeded the task, they also checked the video for July and partially for June.

549 videos were checked, the results of the curators' work can be found at the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ITc0xbyuv0FQaw4zMG_1E2OWIvamryHP/edit#gid=1211962092

All the remaining curators completed their assignments on their own, thank you guys!

With the task set for this week, described above, it turned out that some curators did not know how to use hydra, the lead curator helped them deal with hydra and master it. Result: at the moment, all the remaining curators understand and check licenses very well, as well as actively use hydra.

The working group of curators has now become optimized and efficient, ready to cope with the loads.

The Lead Curator took it upon themselves this week to check all incoming videos. All videos are verified. View table: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fMtGsd7oDcU9N_ylZ8ilIM-nLhaiWgH2/edit#gid=1211962092

In August, the work on the bauti 10 table was completed, 
4196 videos were checked and all are entered in the table with license verification, the result of the curatorial group's work can be found here:
