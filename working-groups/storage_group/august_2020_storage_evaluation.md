## 3 Performance Review
### 3.1 User Reports
User reports are a collection of forum and Telegram posts included to help understand user feedback on this role. This is not a conclusive list.
#### 3.1A - Role reports
* The storage lead created a post explaining that all the roles were filled, but one storage provider was still getting set up: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/103
* There was at least one forum post indicating issues with storage payments being missed, this is both due to the storage lead, or another party making an appropriate proposal and also at times due to the council not voting through these proposals: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/35?replyIdx=3
