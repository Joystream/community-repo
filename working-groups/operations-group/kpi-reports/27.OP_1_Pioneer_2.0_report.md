# 27.OP-1 - Pioneer 2.0

### Task 1

Built the Pioneer 2 locally: https://i.imgur.com/bTJvg9e.png

Wanted to point the local Pioneer 2 to Sumer RPC endpoint, but it appeared that Sumer and Olympia are incompatible in terms of data types. https://t.me/HydraDevs/1199

Asked for tJOY for Olympia: https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/813361923172335648/901886950573764668


Question: is there any way to develop Pioneer without the need to recompile the whole thing? It takes forever :)



### Task 2


Went through the [Contributions Guide](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Have one thing to suggest regarding the tests:

> Write tests (when including business logic) or add a storyboook (when you're creating a new component).

It would be beneficial to point to some how-to guide or example of how such tests should be structured. The rest of the document seems clear and common-sense.

### Task 3

Went through the "good first issues": https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/labels/good%20first%20issue I think I found out how to fix the issue https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/1480 but need guidance on how to set up council and create WG openings in Pioneer 2. 


Went through the [development README](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/blob/main/docs/README.md). One question I have is that do I need to run `joystream-node` locally or this is not required? 


### Task 4 

Honestly, I think the current Bounty process is a little heavyweight, so making community bounty out of each and every `Pioneer2` issue would probably be an overkill. Especially for smaller-sized tasks (and most "good-first" tickets are rather small.) My suggestion would be to triage all the issues which JSG doesn't plan to work on in the nearest future, and depending in their size and complexity (estimated in T-shirt sizes) decide whether to create Bounties for them or not. 

To improve the presentation of the tickets, I suggest the following information to be added to the description:

1. Exact steps to reproduce

2. Expected result (behavior)

3. Actual result
