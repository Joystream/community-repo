## Operations Tasks & Budget Workflow

1. A task or tasks are assigned by `The Council` to `Operations` via an approved `text proposal`. These tasks are added to this list on the `community-repo`: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/operations/operations_task_list.md
	* if a task has not been approved and added to this file, then it shouldn't be worked on until it has
	* anyone can propose an addition to the `task list`, they do not have to be a council member, it can be anyone in the community, but it should pass a council vote
2. `Operations` should then perform some basic research to decide on what the task would cost to complete AND the expected time it would take to complete. Each individual `task` should be then submitted as a `text proposal` to `The Council`. This allows `The Council` to decide whether the cost of the task is worth it.
	* Multiple tasks shouldn't be submitted at once, as this creates a challenge when deciding on the value of individual tasks for the platform.
	* It should be mentioned how the `task` would be paid for: either through a `spending proposal` or through `worker payments` (managed by the `Operations Lead`)
	* Alternatively, the task could be requested to be a bounty. Being a bounty allows for the possibility of `Jsgenesis` to reimburse the costs involved.
3. Once the cost of the `task` has been approved by `The Council`, then `Operations` can proceed with working on it.
	* If the `task` ends up taking longer or costing more than expected, another `text proposal` should be created before further work is done. This `text proposal` should mention the current costs (which should still be paid) and what the expectation of overage will be. This would allow `The Council` to decide if the extended costs are worth it.
4. Upon `The Council` approving of the cost of a task, the `Operations Lead` can pay the appropriate workers via `worker payments` or a `spending proposal` (this should be stated in the `text proposal`). The lead can pay `up to 50%` of the approved cost to the worker before completion.
