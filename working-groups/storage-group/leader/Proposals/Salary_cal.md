# Objective 

This document to address the server operator's compensation. 


## The DAO rewards SWG and DWG for:
- Investment in hardware
- Service availability
- Server capacity
- Bandwidth
- Operator availability 
- Skills 
- Provide performance metrics. 

## What activities expected from SWG and DWG operator:
- Run services
- Monitor services.
- Respond to services issues
- Upgrade software
- Upgrade hardware 
- Optimize deployment. 


## SWG and DWG services deliverables:
- Services availability
- Storage capacity
- Bandwidth capacity
- Processing
- Providing performance metrics.


## Rewards approaches
- Skill and time
  - DAO have to compensate for both active and standby time.
  - DAO have to compensate for server cost risk free. 
- Deliverable


# Historical back group


In the past this calculation was used: https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327?post=3576.
Adopt a skill and time approach, which make the operator employee and by Definition does not ajust to with the objective of providing a service. 


The below formula was used initially to come with SWG salary. 

## Formula
```
%TOTAL_SALARY = (%BASE_SALARY + % SERVER_COST + %BONUS) * %PENALTY

%TOTAL SALARY_IN_JOY = %TOTAL_SALARY / %JOY_PRICE
```

### %BASE_SALARY
```
%DEVOPS_MONTHLY_SALARY *[{10+ %EXTRA_HOURS}/160]  
```

-	Default: SWG/DWG(625)

| Variable                         | Default | Detail                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| %DEVOPS_MONTHLY_SALARY           | 10K     |                                                                                              |
| %EXTRA_HOURS                     | 0       |                                                                                              |
| [{(30/3   )+ %EXTRA_HOURS}/160]  | 0.0625  | worker needs to spend 20 minutes (1/3 of an hour) per day * 30 days per month ~ 10 hours.    |
|                                  |         | 160 = 20*8 = number of hours in an average working month, 8 hr per day for 20 days.          |

### %SERVER_COST

```
%SERVER_COST = %AVERAGE_SERVER_COST * ( %STORAGE_CAPACITY_PROVIDED_IN_TB / %RECOMMENDED_CAPACITY_IN_TB )
```

-	Default: SWG(150) DWG(100)

| Variable                        | Default | Detail                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| %AVERAGE_SERVER_COST            | 150     | Average cost of the server                            |
| %STORAGE_CAPACITY_PROVIDED_IN_TB| 10T     | The capacity of the server storage in TB              |
| %RECOMMENDED_CAPACITY_IN_TB     | 10T     | The recommended server capacity set by the lead in TB |

### %BONUS
-	Default: 0 
-	Totally discretionary 

### %PENALTY
-	Default: 1 

| Variable                                 | Default | Detail                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Server up time                           | 1       | Set Penalty to %SERVERS_UPTIME |
| Respond to emergency within 24hrs        | 1       | Set Penalty to 0.5             |
| Respond to routine upgrade within 72hrs  | 1       | Set Penalty to 0.75            |
| Upgrade capacity within 30 days          | 1       | Set Penalty to 0               |

## Disadvantage
- Does not make a direct relation between the rewards and provided capacity
- It is very subjective to quantify been available and time needed to monitor the services. 
- In this approach it's fair to have two rates for active hours and standby hours. The standby was missed totally.
- Devop engineer salary is very subjective based on geographical. 
- Resulted on a SWG $775 salary at a time when the price of Joy was very low made it hard to adopt. 
- The model was hard to adjust the numbers.


## Advantages 
- Similar compensation scheme to the rest of the DAO (Rest of the DAO worker are compensated passed of skills and time)


# Proposal 

## This proposal focus's on deliverables
- Services availability
- Storage capacity
- Bandwidth capacity
- Providing performance metrics.

## The proposal made to encourage:
- Node operator to optimize server cost
- Storage provider to provide the max storage rewardable
- Distribution provider to provide higher bandwidth
- Maximum uptime
- Operator availability
- Make it advantageous for operator to add more servers and cheaper for the DAO.


This proposal assumes the cost of the skills and time is encompassed in the deliverable cost. 

## Formula
```
TOTAL TERM SALARY = ((%BASE_SALARY + % REWARDS  + %BONUS) * %PENALTY )
```

### %BASE_SALARY
The objective of this section is to offer assurance and pay for the basic services i.e. hardware (including processing), setup and basic services.

```
%SERVER_COST_MULTIPLIER * %AVERAGE_COST_OF_SERVER * %NUMBER_OF_SERVERS  * %QN * %METRICS_PROVICED 
```

## Process
- The salaries are set with each OKR with the below variables reviewed
  - %JOY_PRICE
  - %SERVER_COST_MULTIPLIER
  - %AVERAGE_COST_OF_SERVER
  - %PRICE_PER_GB
  - %BANDWIDTH_MULTIPLIER
  - %UPPER_STORAGE_LIMIT 
- Salary changes should be approved by two councils.
- Salary changes take effect at the next council period after council approval.
- All changes to the the salary must not exceed 25% of the current salary in Joy.

## Advantages 
- Focus on deliverables and group added value to the DAO
- line up the DWG, SWG AND validators on their own category
- Flexible
- Reflect storage and CDN market value

## Disadvantages 
- Different compensation scheme to the rest of the DAO (Rest of the DAO worker are compensated passed of skills and time)
- Long term need accurate collection of the data.
