# Storage working group [Objectives and Key Results](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-examples-and-how-to-write-them) 

Main quality criteria for Storage Providers:
- Speed
- Capacity
- Reliability
- Geographic Location
- Resilience

## Speed

The Lead has to 
- KR1 set targets and reevaluate success criteria to grade providers (eg. A-F) based on up/download speed and latency.
- KR2 score active providers and applicants and publish their specs and maintenance contact.
- KR3 publish targets and let the council approve.
The council oversees measurements and delegates the improvement and maintenance of monitoring tools to the Operations working group.

## Capacity

- KR4 Storage Providers must maintain as much free space as has been uploaded during the last three months.
- KR5 These numbers must be published by the lead in Storage Reports.

## Reliability

- KR6 Offline providers need to be replaced by the Lead.
- KR7 Maintainers must respond on discord within a day.

## Location

- KR8 To ensure good coverage for users the Lead defines preferred locations in opernings according to regional requirements set by the council.

## Resilience

- KR9 The Lead makes sure that enough Providers with sufficient free space are active. The number is defined by the council and KPI.

## Rewards
Lead and workers get awarded for achieving above goals. The council secretary informs the Lead about the amount once per term. If major goals are missed anyone can open a proposal to replace the Lead following the process described in [WG Lead Term Limits](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/rules/WG_Lead_Term_Limits.md)).
