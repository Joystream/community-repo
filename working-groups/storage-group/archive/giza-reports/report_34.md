# Storage Working Group Status Reporting - 34

## Storage Lead : _0x2bc_

### Report:

This is the 34th report for the Storage Provider Working Group. 

* We went through Giza upgrade smoothly but are still behind the KPI 42.SP-1 - Maintain Storage System. See more explanations below

* We still has an issue with usage of locally installed Query Nodes. It prevents the full launch of all SP nodes. @freakstatic has found out three workarounds. The final approval on which workaround to use is required from JSGenesis team .

* 7/9 storage operators upgraded their nodes

* 9/9 buckets were created

* Following Giza upgrade, the report format to be adjusted next time
