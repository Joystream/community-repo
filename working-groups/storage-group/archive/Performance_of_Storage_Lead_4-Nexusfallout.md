### Compare with [Helpdesk](https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk/tree/master/roles/storage-lead)

3. Once a week, Storage Providers provide ``df -h``
4. Do ``ipfs stats repo`` by request

### Performance for the Lead

- At least 95% of the work he did

### Performance for the Workers

*Referring to the reports, it is impossible to understand how effective the Providers are. We still don't have tools for it. But our Stellar line-up ``@tomato``, ``@nexusfallout``, ``@freakstatic`` and ``@l1dev`` are trying to find the way every day*

- `joystreamstats` 

- `julysake` 

- `0x2bc` 

- `kalpakci` 

- `seainvestor` 

- `maxlevush` 

- `joyval` 

- `dapplooker` 

- `godshunter` 

### Suggestion for the path forward

According to [WG Lead Term Limits](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/rules/WG_Lead_Term_Limits.md) Lead's term soon ends. 

`4-Nexusfallout` showed great efficiency. We would like to continue working with him. But more worthy candidates should try the role. The Council will decide the further fate of Storage Lead referring to the results of the applications.
