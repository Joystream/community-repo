## Community Roadmap Process

This will eventually outline the process by which the Community Roadmap is developed. For now it is a very rough outline and some basic thoughts about aspects that should probably be discussed.

#### Initial thoughts
- Where to discuss? Should we have a dedicated Discord channel?
- Where to draft? Community repo and/or Notion?
	- Should we have a dedicated repo for this?
- Where to store? Community repo & Notion?
- We really need something better than .md files on Github, it may be worth looking at a solution like Gitbook or Docusaurus so users can easily navigate and maybe it would make contributing easier.
- How to agree on phases (`initial rollout`, `stability phase`, `initial growth`)?
- How to deal with time when planning and structuring things? (blockheights, weeks, months?)
- How to agree on roles necessary to make governance system work well (i.e. Council Secretary)
- How do we structure projects and initiatives? (i.e. a specific initiative like Joystreamstats, a custom Atlas fork that supports music)?
- What are the minimum number of proposals required to get mainnet operational? (This would mean opening/hiring proposals, mint proposals but `not` runtime/system related proposals/sudo actions that JSG would do)

#### Draft Process
1. Proposal to create initial discussion
2. Create Draft/Template
3. Gather community feedback and summarize
4. Submit to Notion, label to be changed to `Draft Submitted`
5. Upon discussion timeframe (What time period?) the draft should then be submitted as a PR to the community repo and submitted via a proposal.
6. If proposal approved by council, label to be changed to `Approved via testnet council` and `community repo` persons to merge PR.
