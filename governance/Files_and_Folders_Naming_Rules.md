# Community Repo Files and folders naming rules

v1.0

## Folders

Folders should generally be named in lower case characters, with '-' as words separator. In other words, in lower kebab case: `example-folder-in-lower-kebab-case`


## Files

For regular files, the general rule should be to use lower snake case: `lower_Snake_Case`. Uppercase is allowed, as well as numbers.

Not recommended to use:
1. Spaces
2. Non-English characters
3. Characters used in URLs: #, &, ?, :, /


These naming conventions can be overruled by the specific requirements dictated by respective software tools or libraries that a contributor choses to use for their coding contributions.
