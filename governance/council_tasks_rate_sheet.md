## Council Tasks Rate Sheet

This document covers the tasks a council is expected to accomplish during a given council term and provides basic rates. These rates have not been agreed upon by the council, and rates might change depending on the scope of work and the scale of the platform. For now it mainly serves to provide users with an idea of what to charge for each task.

Each task includes a rate, which is the amount of tokens commonly charged via `spending proposal` and a frequency, which is the expected number of times a task should be completed within a council term.
