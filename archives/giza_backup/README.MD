This folder contains a partial backup of some on-chain data from the `giza` Joystream testnet. It was created to archive historical on-chain information from the project which never migrated across to newer testnets or the mainnet.

This backup was completed by using a very old version of Pioneer that was used up until the launch of `Olympia`. The data was accessed by using simple chain state queries and copy pasting information. Therefore there may be some problems with the data, so it is provided as is.

This data was only available as a community member (@l1dev) had continued to run an endpoint for the old, no longer used testnet as a public service and without this it may have been near impossible to gather any of this. So a very big thank you is due to @l1dev for this!

The `giza` testnet was discontinued once `olympia` was launched: https://blog.joystream.org/announcing-olympia/

This backup was created to document and archive the early history of the Joystream DAO and hopefully provide insight to future generations about how the early community of the Joystream project communicated and interacted using a very novel (and basic, not to mention extremely slow) on-chain forum and worked on 47 iterations of KPIs to help build a governance system on a highly experimental DAO.

The interactions and governance things discussed in this data are from a highly unique point in the history of blockchains and the internet, when web3 and NFTs were not yet remotely widely used or known.

Included are:
- All proposals and proposal threads (no comments--this would have taken too many resources to achieve)
- All forum posts, threads & categories
- All memberships

Not included:
- Full timestamp information
- Balances
- Proposal comments
- Any part of the video/content directories
- Any part of the Working Groups
- Any part of the Validator or staking information
- Any off-chain information (such as data relating to the Founding Members program)
- Any data except for text (images and avatars will not be preserved)

Below are some timestamps which may help future generations to more fully understand the data as it would take too long to figure out how to dump all the data fully.

Blocktime: `6 seconds` (`ideally)`
ideally, there were many instances of fluctuating blocktimes so you'll have to guess some of it)

Blockheight / Timestamp (UNIX):

`5,489,400` / `1651232508002`

Nothing has been edited or modified on my end and to my knowledge this is an accurate backup of on-chain content when the `giza` network was discontinued.
