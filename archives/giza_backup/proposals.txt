      title: Curator Working Group Report 19,
      description: This is the third lead curator report in two days.nIt is the responsibility of the lead curator to submit a report once a week, link to the rules https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/rules/Content_Curator_WG_Lead-Tasks_Reporting_Requirements.mdnnYesterday I submitted a report 2 times, they were not approved because 2 curators @IgreX @lyazufey1812  were outraged by the assessment of their effectiveness (they are also acting consuls), and they were also not happy that the lead curator did not take into account their work. But, before submitting the report, the curators did not provide me with any information about their work done (therefore, their work is not in this report)nnnAfter canceling two reports yesterday, I spoke with these two curators @IgreX @lyazufey1812 in the curator group. They gave me a table with the work done for a week, a link to the table https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LMYztVNw6za31H5OZBA8zX8OEv09fqDSUnkRYYacDYU/edit#gid=0nnHaving looked at the results of the work done by the curators, I come to the conclusion that the curators do not understand the importance of checking the original licenses. There are no licenses indicated in the table, this is probably a problem, since bounty 10 was previously stopped due to the same checks. JS GENESIS also repeatedly drew our attention to this.nnAs a lead curator, I declare that such work undermines our previous work (for example, the bounty table 10) if the incoming videos are checked in the same way, it is likely that we will have another table and punishment (as was the case with the bounty table 10)nnJS GENESIS has mentioned many times that it is important to check the validity of licenses.nnBelow I provide a link to the table of the rest of the group and the lead with verified licenses: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fMtGsd7oDcU9N_ylZ8ilIM-nLhaiWgH2/edit#gid=1211962092,

      title: Operations Task: Council Daily Bot,
      description: PR: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/pull/317nnDescription: Create a bot that posts once per day, and informs the #council channel on Discord what day of the council it currently is.nnFor example: `It is block number #12345678, there are now 3 days remaining for this council` (I posted something similar in Discord: https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812343711870091285/880444158907670619)nnReasoning: I have been a council member several times over more than a year, one challenge with this role is keeping track of time, especially where KPIs are concerned. Even with consistent block times, the timing of blocks still drifts a small amount. Sometimes the council term is several hours longer or only within 1%. For this reason each day of the council is impossible to track using a calendar and therefore it becomes extremely challenging to coordinate things in a timed manner.nn(continued below),

      title: Bounty 10 solution,
      description: Due to the network crash (https://blog.joystream.org/announcing-antioch/) a number of submissions for bounty #10 were not able to be graded. This bounty was already very behind schedule and with the added crash I have tried to find a solution that pays out users as quickly as possible without adding to the current bounty/council workload further.nnAlthough we could ignore these submissions and just ask people to resubmit we have the opportunity to do the right thing and mint tokens to pay those users who spent the time to enter their videos. It is likely that in the future (after mainnet) we might encounter situations like these, so it is a good idea for the community to have a way of rectifying issues like these.nnI will also ask Jsgenesis to fill the fiat pool with the same amount asked, but it is up to them on whether to do so.nnI will be managing these payments manually and will post a summary of the payouts once completed in the forums. I have set up a new account for this purpose: 5FHhAVPtP5vVEDTHwtcm6REyEaVDqhTFLMdqH9mnFwN6sY4JnnNone of the tokens will be used for paying myself or for any other purpose than what has been stated.nnNumber of inaccessible videos: 76nnProposed amount to pay each inaccessible submission: $3nnTotal asked: $228 (current exchange rate is 0.0000391, so the token quantity would be 5831202)nnBounty Thread: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/292nnDiscussion thread: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/361,

The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn* The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.n* Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.n* Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.n* The current lead can also apply for the opening.n* Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* A guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* Also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsnnIn the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

I will begin creating a small series of things for new users and give them a way to at least start using some of the platform and give funds for valuable contributions (this is intended for newer users, not older users). There are at least 10 days until the new system launches, so it would be good to have something to give new users to do.nnAnything not used for this specific purpose will be used for the purposes outlined below. I will not receive any of this amount.nnI am asking for 15m tJOY (exchange rate is 0.0000262 = $393)nnI maintain an account that is used for multiple purposes and it is called the give account. It is primarily used to give new users tokens for things like:nn* applying for roles which require a large amount of stakenn* replacing lost funds if there are system issues (for example: the operations group's stake has a bug)nn* rewarding helpful usersnn* giving funds to users so they can afford to make proposalsnn* helping particularly valuable, new users get a step up in elections or just testing out the platformnnIn the past it has been funded by Jsgenesis, myself and eventually the council, but as we try to be more like a DAO, having such funding be accounted for by the council is important. If any users are sent funds from this account, it is explained that the council has funded it and it does not come from me, no users are asked to return any of the funds, they are simply given out.nnPrevious proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/773nnAccount: 5EWcsnwRnTz3WWJ19dUZdWRy7tWH7CQMZhccZM4BSd7uurJEnBalance: 3.9m tJOY,

      title: Curator Lead opening (term limit),
      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a `firing proposal` > also a `begin review` proposal and also finally a `fill opening` proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the `term limits` proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nnThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn1. The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.nn2. Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.nn3. Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.nn4. The current lead can also apply for the opening.nn5. Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn- a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)nn- also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.nnn- In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the councilnn- In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nn### Exceptionsnn- In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.n,

The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this `opening` proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the `term limits` proposal:nn#### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nnThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn1. The council secretary or deputy will create an `opening` for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.nn2. Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.nn3. Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.nn4. The current lead can also apply for the opening.nn5. Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new `opening` proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as: nn- a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via `spending proposal`)nn- also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.nn* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the councilnn* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nn#### Exceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the `opening` proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a firing proposal > also a begin review proposal and also finally a fill opening proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn* The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.n* Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.n* Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.n* The current lead can also apply for the opening.n* Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn* The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.n* Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.n* Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.n* The current lead can also apply for the opening.n* Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

      title: Bounty discussion: Promoting JS as a DAO,
      description: Explained here: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/414nnIf approved we could break this bounty into 3 parts with rewards for each.nnNotes:nn- Building and maintaining a list of of valuable forums and outlets to send posts about the platform (in a managed, targeted way) will be something we can utilize on a continuous basis. Targeting the DAO ecosystem with some information about this platform might attract some more people here.nn- By engaging with the DAO ecosystem we can benefit in many ways, although to start with just building awareness of this project as a DAO would be useful. Even though this project is a great example of a highly sophisticated DAO, it isn't mentioned much in news articles discussing DAOs.nn- Eventually we will get a blog module on Joystream (https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/2148) so we can use this bounty as practice for that. We can start thinking about what useful information we could include in blog posts and where we could share or promote them outside of the platform itself.,

      title: Runtime Upgrade, attempt 2.0,
      description: Hey all!nnAs you may remember, we had to `veto` the approved [runtime upgrade proposal](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/1043), as we discovered a non-trivial bug in the final minutes.nnWe now ask you permission to do the upgrade by `sudo`, at around 1300 CET tomorrow (25.01), ie. block `#4191010`. nAlthough not ideal, there are two good reasons to ask:n1. We don't want to add even further delays (a proposal would add at least 48h)n2. A runtime upgrade proposal means that whenever the 16th approval vote is cast, the upgrade happens 48h later. Meaning it could be in the middle of the night. We're a distributed team, and it's difficult to have the team ready to perform the tasks associated with the release at unknown hours. nnFor `olympia`, this issue will be fixed, as a proposal can include an `execute_at` block, but alas - not yet.,

      description: As we are getting ready to deploy Sumer, we are making the upgrade proposal now.nnThere are still some open PRs to the [Sumer branch](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/sumer), and most likely more to come, but they will be documentation, and infrastructure. The runtime is finalized, and the checksum can thus be verified. nnWe'll make a post below when the draft PR to master is ready, and will add instructions on howto verify the checksum of the runtime.nnFinally, as we need to be present for the actual upgrade (deploying the query-node, upgrading pioneer and atlas, etc.) we hope this can be approved swiftly AND within working hours we hope to deploy Wednesday, but Thursday would of course also be fine!n,

      description: being a Deputy Council Secretary last term, i started to replace and rename some files in `kpi` folder. i did it because there was a real mess: kpi reports were placed in different places, WGs reports were placed in `council` folder, old kpi reports from previous testnets were placed in `sumer` folder (the name of current testnet), some kpi reports were with wrong names (i mean not only unacceptable symbols but also wrong kpi names and numbers), some files and folders were duplicated. nni fixed it all. it's time add these changes to `community-repo`! after approving this proposal, PR https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/pull/536 will be merged. i'll list here all the changes in outline. if you want to see all the specific changes and compare current version with mine, please visit this page https://github.com/swasilenko/community-repo/tree/changes/council/kpi,

Among other things, there is a difficult and long task with the final Bounty10 table, the filling of which takes a long time and with big errors, and it must be completed.nOn the other hand, I am for turnover, especially in a test network, and I will be happy to help a new curator, if there is one.,

The current storage system is in poor condition so an increase in budget is warranted.nn![](https://i.imgur.com/tQaHjm1.png)nn* We are currently discussing increasing the scope and frequency of the storage lead reporting requirements, to account for this the lead reward has been increased. The storage lead must also pay for and maintain their own storage node which makes this role different than other roles on the network.nn* The operations budget has been reduced by $10 as some of the expected expenses (running endpoints) will not be hired via the group and will instead use `spending proposals`. Based on discussions with the operations lead and some people who intend to apply for the group as workers, we may have to use a system which combines WG payments with some form of `spending proposals`. The exact structure of this has not been decided yet.nn* There has been discussion of changing the budget system in the future: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/428 At this stage I do not think we are ready for this, but the `operations group` does use this system and once we have built a system that works and is accountable we can look at incorporating the same system into the other working groups. This would be a system where the lead is given a $ budget and produces a report of how they intend to spend and the council provides a list of tasks/requirements.,

      title: Task: Opportunities & Applications UI,
      description: The pioneer [WG page](/#/working-groups) is a slow way to get an overview job applications. Another way is to query the CLI for every working group:n- `cli working-groups:openings -g [operations|storageProviders|curators]` listing openings with their ID,n- `cli working-groups:opening ID -g GROUP` for details like WG application ID,n- `cli working-groups:application WG_APPL_ID -g GROUP` the currently only way for leads to review applications.nnIt can be expected that in the future a lot of job openings and applications will be created. From a short research it does not look like JSG planned a new WG interface for neither [pioneer 1](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/labels/working-group) nor [pioneer 2](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/labels/scope%3Aworking-groups):nn> The Working Group leader is considered an advanced role and might not be critical for an MVP. Working group leader actions might be implemented as CLI commands. ([joystream/pioneer#315](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/315))nnPersonal note: Hiring developers as long-term workers of the OWG similarly to other working groups might not be optimal and could be replaced with task based hiring when it becomes easier to manage (create and review) openings.,

      description: On the previous testnet I distributed about 1m tokens to 30-40 forum posts to try and provide an incentive to high quality posts (the funding came from my own tokens). The amounts varied between 10k-100k and I used my own decision on who to reward. The process I use is described here: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/183nnThe idea is to create a continuous way for new users on the platform to have another way of receiving rewards and to reward high quality contributions.nnI'm creating this spending proposal to ask for 3m tokens to distribute to forum posts, the aim this time is to increase the reward to ~100-150k JOY (or more) for each post or thread that qualifies to help build up activity on the forums (for both posts that relate to the project as well as off topic posts). nnThe account the payment would be sent to is 5GW7KFL9dGPLKUVM8dHX4RPX6p3UXdmiJaVWtSthr39HVWfs which has the member ID of `forumrewards`. All of the tokens received would be used for the purpose stated and no tokens would be used by me for any other purposes.,

      title: Cut KPI-17 rewards by 35%,
      description: Please read carefully before you vote. nnDue to the fact the Council Members were never able to earn the maximum possible rewards set for KPIs, see [report I've prepared](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qhkta1ObthuS4CmBHIqweoRIz9UiVMbygqc49t37oX8/edit?usp=sharing), I propose to reduce the incentives caps for next round of KPIs, that is, round 17, by 35%. nnWhy am I proposing this? nnThe main rationale is to redistribute the KPI reward funds that are currently not used by CMs to form better working groups budgets. For instance, current Operations WG weekly budgets of approximately $170 do not reflect the value the workers of this group deliver to the community and therefore must be changed. So if KPIs rewards are reduced by 35%, the KPI work done by CMs currently can still be rewarded in full, but we get at least $1000/week to redistribute to WG weekly budgets.nnThe proposed cut can be revisited by the Council later if so required. ,

      description: Original proposal is here: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/historical/213 It was approved but the grace period meant that the tokens were never issued before the network issues.nnI've come up with a way to turn the Community Repo bounty into a contest which will allow the community to decide the winners rather than the council. The entire process is contained in this PR: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/pull/128nnBasic process: 1. Users submit entries via PR and a thread on the forums. The first 10 users to submit valid entries get 150k each regardless of competition outcome. 2. The voting process takes place on Discord 3.

It is up to the community/council to decide if they want to replace any current lead of this Working Group. If this proposal is approved, and a user wants to choose a new lead, they must create a `fire lead` proposal first, and then a `fill opening` proposal--both of these should include reasons for these choices and it is up to the council to vote on them.nnThe Council Secretary will not create any further propoals related to this.,

      title: Operations Lead opening (term limit),
      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a `firing proposal` > also a `begin review` proposal and also finally a `fill opening` proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the `term limits` proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nnThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn1. The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.nn2. Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.nn3. Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.nn4. The current lead can also apply for the opening.nn5. Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn- a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)nn- also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.nnn- In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the councilnn- In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nn### Exceptionsnn- In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

      title: Addendum to the rules for new Bounty ,
      description: For pre-quartile community discussion: nnhttps://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/643nnIt was decided that it is necessary to create a video on the Banner according to the above-mentioned Bounty rules.nnYou can familiarize yourself with the Bounty rules at this link:nnhttps://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/398nnAfter a discussion with @ bwhm0, it was decided to create a bounty based on previously agreed rules.nnAlso, having come to a general agreement, it was decided that it was necessary to add a small part to these rules, which can be found at this link:nnhttps://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/398#issuecomment-936229639.nnThese rules were introduced in order to avoid incorrect situations when participating in this Bounty and also served as an appendage to the recently created conditions.nnThese particular points will make it easier for the Bounty Manager to use and select future videos for the banner.,

      title: Allow 20% discretionary spending for WGs,
      description: Discussion thread: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/487nnIf this proposal is approved:n`The leads of each group can spend up to 20% of their worker budget (excluding the lead's reward) each week. This amount does not accrue and is reset each week. For example, if a Working Group currently has a Worker Budget of $200, they can use up to $40 in spending proposals. The Council is not required to vote approve, and can vote as they deem necessary. If a Lead creates a spending proposal unrelated to their working group, it would not be considered to be a part of this discretionary spending`nnThe leads can decide what they want to use these for (with some sort of sensible explanation): such as creating scripts, rewarding good workers, paying for unexpected expenses related to the working group.,

All this means is that the council secretary/deputy are not responsible for making the proposals that usually are opened, anyone with enough tokens is still free to make their own opening, slash, firing or hiring propopsals as they wish to (and the council can vote on them how they want to).,

      title: Bounty 18 + 24 report improvements,
      description: Pre-proposal Discussion: https://pioneer.joystreamstats.live/#/forum/threads/752nnIf approved, this proposal would request that the spreadsheets for both Bounty 18 + 24 are updated to include statistical information covering every week the bounties have been running. These changes should be fairly easy to achieve within the spreadsheet, and I would expect the changes to be added within 7-14 days at most. These are our most regular, active bounties and developing a better understanding of them from a wider perspective would be great.nnI would also ask the council to approve $50 funding for these changes ($50 for each spreadsheet), that the person doing these changes can request via a `spending proposal`. ($100 in total, $50 for bounty 18 and $50 for bounty 24)nnThis would include:nn* How many entries per week?nn* How many rejected entries per week?nn* How many entries in total?nn* How much has been rewarded each week (shown in a table)?nn* How much has been rewarded in total?nn* How much has each user been rewarded across all weeks of each bounty? (for example: John has made $43 from 12 entries)nnThe reason for this additional information, is that it is extremely valuable for understanding the bounties and can also be useful for JSG when trying to understand how the bounties are doing.,

      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a firing proposal > also a begin review proposal and also finally a fill opening proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn* The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.n* Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.n* Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.n* The current lead can also apply for the opening.n* Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.n,

So far we count 29 with many [aspirants](https://www.joystream.org/founding-members/leaderboards).nnI propose to credit @Shtihmas 10M for the channel [Joystream movie](https://play.joystream.org/channel/83) - it contains many great videos targeted at the whole community including non-FM (also search for messages by @Shtihmas#9582 on discord) like [this](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/813361923172335648/933247917471453234). he was part of the (failed) Operations Promotion team and continues to keep producing!nn[How to become FM](https://pioneer.joystreamstats.live/#/forum/threads/877) - share your experiencennAn idea: FM and council members each could mentor at least one non-FM to help them increase the visibility of contributions (for example with a FM report to the community-repo). From my understanding contributions should be visible and support the DAO. Involvement into the community or bureaucratic processes are important parts too. Probably does not need an official role but someone could facility this.nnThe numbers show that points are not the only metric. The lowest score of any FM is 1450 while many non-FM members are past that. Some types of activities are valued higher because they have a higher value to the DAO. For example I became initial FM after contributing code for three months while many have been around much longer:n```n14527 @razumvn11052 @leet_joyn8325 @okaykon7990 @botzmannn7094 @narniecn4997 @arseniy2706n4940 @xfactorusn4815 @zazikn4495 @hayabusan4480 @shtihmasn4345 @godshuntern4040 @goldmembern3500 @rustamonen3400 @alekjoyn3355 @joyvaln3322 @1337membern3300 @sashan3191 @mats4n3170 @gorenien3137 @vagifn3125 @wasabin```nnIf you all advanced there would be 50 FM. Personally i do not mind how many there are and obvously not everyone needs to become programmer but i am still interested to know you more. Also founding members will eventually need to be qualified to maintain all aspects of the Joystream DAO. This needs a lot more training.nnHow would this DAO look like with 200 active members? I do not expect all FM to be active daily but what would be the roles of 200 actors? Good answers could count as FM contribution :),

      title: update bounties-status.json,
      description: i noticed that there are wrong open bounties on the site https://www.joystream.org/ru/get-started. i asked @laura to fix her mistakes (https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/822087161104957470/931248807851741234), but she didn't do it. we have too many newcomers now, that are interested in open bounties, so i don't want to confuse them with wrong information. that's why i fixed the file by myself. i want to add these changes to github and site. after approving this proposal, my PR will be merged, and information will be finally updated ,

      description: I propose to dismiss the pascual curator due to his zero activity from the moment he was hired. The curator in the working chat replied that he had a lot to do in real life.nDue to the fact that the payment of the curators is weekly (every 6 hours), I consider it unreasonable to pay.nAlso, Some of the curators only started working this past week. I will reduce the payment of inactive curators/,

      title: Fire Content Curator WG Lead,
      description: The distinguishing features of the testnet are regular experiments - this is the only way to create a more perfect system and get ready for the mainnet. The DAO management system must be flexible and quickly respond to changes, if we have the same persons acting according to the methodology, then management will inevitably lose the ability to adapt.nnnProblems of the current content group that need to solutions:nn1. General access to google tables, anyone can make their own changes:nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fMtGsd7oDcU9N_ylZ8ilIM-nLhaiWgH2/edit#gid=1211962092nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E4iPjDiGjoVCgyNX_GmYPdmSDMMyGayJ/edit#gid=1461462558nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VmOGKtxtPXP79Z6GFP_-JeElpfUPtlrW/edit#gid=1461462558nn2. Incorrect setting of the videos language and categories. The curators do not fix the problem, the current Leader does not offer solutions.nIn the mainnet, it will be very difficult for a user to find a video that matches his preference (language/category), such a user will not stay in the Atlas for a long time.nn3. Ineffective work of curators, the same videos are checked several times by various curators. For example, the video https://play.joystream.org/video/7801 is present in all the tables above.nWe need to automate the video check process.nnWith the current load on the testnet, everything works, but in the case of the inevitable scaling of the project the system will fail, and errors in the mainnet will be expensive.nnI also want to remind you that the previous leader resigned on his own, after that he helped the current leader to take his position. https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/391 However, the current leader, after more than 4 months of work, flatly refuses to leave his position despite the statement of a large number of consuls/FM to change the Content Working Group Leader https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/817nnIn accordance with this, I propose to fire the current Content Working Group Leader.,

No news doesn't always means good news, so let's ask JSG to update the Community about what's going on with the project. One of the worrying signs is that Joystream went down from #2 to #8 in [polkaproject](https://polkaproject.com/#/rank) rankings. nnIf council approves this Proposal, I will communicate to JSG the class action request to record a new Community Update. ,

      description: JSG expressed the idea to have [200 FM](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/813361923172335648/931987657528057936) by mainnet. So far we count 29 with many [aspirants](https://www.joystream.org/founding-members/leaderboards).nnI propose to credit @Shtihmas for the channel [Joystream movie](https://play.joystream.org/channel/83) - it contains many great videos targeted at the whole community including non-FM (also search for messages by @Shtihmas#9582 on discord) like [this](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/813361923172335648/933247917471453234). he was part of the (failed) Operations Promotion team and continues to keep producing!nn## [How to become FM](/#/forum/threads/877) - share your experiencennAn idea: FM and council members each could mentor at least one non-FM to help them increase the visibility of contributions (for example with a FM report to the community-repo). From my understanding contributions should be visible and support the DAO. Involvement into the community or bureaucratic processes are important parts too. Probably does not need an official role but someone could facility this.nnThe numbers show that points are not the only metric. The lowest score of any FM is 1450 while many non-FM members are past that. Some types of activities are valued higher because they have a higher value to the DAO. For example I became initial FM after contributing code for three months while many have been around much longer:n```n14527 @razumvn11052 @leet_joyn8325 @okaykon7990 @botzmannn7094 @narniecn4997 @arseniy2706n4940 @xfactorusn4815 @zazikn4495 @hayabusan4480 @shtihmasn4345 @godshuntern4040 @goldmembern3500 @rustamonen3400 @alekjoyn3355 @joyvaln3322 @1337membern3300 @sashan3191 @mats4n3170 @gorenien3137 @vagifn3125 @wasabin```nnIf you all advanced there would be 50 FM. Personally i do not mind how many there are and obvously not everyone needs to become programmer but i am still interested to know you more. Also founding members will eventually need to be qualified to maintain all aspects of the Joystream DAO. This needs a lot more training.nnHow would this DAO look like with 200 active members? I do not expect all FM to be active daily but what would be the roles of 200 actors? Good answers would likely count as FM contribution.,

      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a firing proposal > also a begin review proposal and also finally a fill opening proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn* The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.n* Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.n* Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.n* The current lead can also apply for the opening.n* Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

It is up to the community/council to decide if they want to replace any current lead of this Working Group. If this proposal is approved, and a user wants to choose a new lead, they must create a `fire lead` proposal first, and then a `fill opening` proposal--both of these should include reasons for these choices and it is up to the council to vote on them.nnNOTE: After this proposal is approved, people will have a final 24h to apply for this position.nnThe Council Secretary will not create any further propoals related to this.,

We ask you to make it official. nLink to Github: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/342n  n**To Council Members:**  n* If you vote Approve, the request will be made to add this Bounty as an official (I don't know how much time it will take for them to make a decision, but maybe it is worth to wait).  n* If you vote Reject, it will stay as a Community Bounty (though JSGenesis may decide to reimburse it) and can be launched earlier. It will also be listed on official site. As for inflation, tomato said it will become less of an issue since there is a KPI to address that.  ,

      description: In the [current budget thread](/#/forum/threads/717) i asked:nn> Then we have to trust that the loss in token value was only due to bounties and is temporary? In July we had $33/M, in September it recovered from $25 to $27. Now down to $25 again. Why?nnNo one responded so I took a deeper look and found that [my spending proposal](/#/proposals/451) reduced the value by $2 (see [2021-08-18](https://joystreamstats.live/tokenomics)).nnAlso i found another bug in the tokenomics script about WG spending and updated the reports again: It turned out that OWG has a big surplus (see [PR 467](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/pull/467)).nnSince August i spent about 100h or more ([here](https://git.joystreamstats.live/Operations/community-repo/commits/report-generator-refactor), [here](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/pull/442) and [here](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/pull/428)) on the tokenomics script creating [joystream-lib](https://git.joystreamstats.live/Operations/joystream-lib) which can be used by anyone who is interested to make chain requests a bit more handy.nnIt is not easy for me to determine the correct value to ask for since it will effect the price again.nnBecause `90 M` (`100h * 25 $/h / 27.7 $/M`) sounds a bit much and i got paid `40 M` as [OWG lead](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/working-groups/operations-group) already, I am asking for only 50 M and hope this is acceptable. If approved tokens go into the joystreamstats fund.,

      title: Resub: Hire Curator Lead,
      description: I've decided to create a proposal to hire Igrex as they seem to have shown a good understanding of the curation system on the previous testnet.nnThe payment terms are $25/week. At the current exchange rate this would come out to 23k JOY/6h which totals to about $25.56. I would suggest increasing this number soon but for now it is important to get someone hired and get the WG started.,

      title: Bounty 21 - German Translation,
      description: The bounty 21 asks to translate the [joystream.org](https://www.joystream.org/) website to one of the selected languages.    nGerman wasn't one of that languages but this bounty gives the liberty to ask for approval from Jsgenesis for another language to be accepted.   nMartin (@bwhm) from Jsgenesis [accepted that language](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/862647221635514387/921016964606984192) as a secondary language which grants a reward of $300.   nSince german is a difficult language @crane, which is a native german speaker, has spent a lot of hours in this translation so I think we should give him a reward of $400. So $100 extra which will probably not be reimburse by Jsgenesis so it will be taken from the council budget, but I think they are well deserved.    n   nThis translation submission was already verified by Rikarda (a friend of [@crane](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/members/crane) which is also a native german speaker) and he showed me proof of her verification. Since she is not familiar with crypto, the payment for the review will also go to [@crane](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/members/crane). @Roksolana did a quick reviewer (which I gave a small rewarded of 400k tJOY from my pocket as a thank you) and didn't find any errors. Also @l1dev has given some suggestions on the pull request.    n   nPR: [https://github.com/Joystream/joystream-org/pull/429](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream-org/pull/429)   n   nSo the final payment will be:   n$400 (for the translation) + $160 for the review (which took 8h).   nPlease keep in mind that the council budget will take the costs for the review if Jsgenesis don't reimburse it.   nExchange rate $/tJOY: 0.000025893953410003233   nPayment destination: [@crane](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/members/crane) wallet   nMore information about the bounty [here](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/212)   ,

This tool needs to be run regularly but the content directory size is increasing on a daily basis, HELIOS used to take a few minutes to run, but more recently it has taken me 39 minutes to fully run.nnWe need a script that runs HELIOS once per 3-4 hours, and takes the results and puts them in a JSON file with the date/time of when it was run. The output could be displayed on joystreamstats.live or somewhere so that everyone can have access to the results and to also avoid a situation where 10 people are running the tool at the same time and probably slowing down the storage network.,

      description: ## Antioch WG Budget 1nnDiscussion thread: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/355?page=1nn* This budget assumes our storage requirements to be 160 GB at this stage. The current storage directory size is 73 GB so this allows us quite a lot of buffer.n* Based on the discussion so far it looks like $40/month for storage providers for server costs, this means that storage workers are being paid approximately $10/week for their time.n* The Curator Lead rewards are higher than the Storage Lead rewards as the Curator Lead workload is significantly higher.nn### Agreed ValuesnnStorage Lead: $30/week (or more depending on scale)nStorage Worker: $20/weeknnCurator Lead: $50/week (or more depending on scale)nCurator Worker: $25/weeknn### Budget for 5 workersn| Role           | Amount | Quantity | Subtotal |n|----------------|--------|----------|----------|n| Curator lead   | 50     | 1        | 50       |n| Curator worker | 25     | 5        | 125      |n| Storage lead   | 30     | 1        | 30       |n| Storage worker | 20     | 5        | 100      |n|                |        |          |          |n|                |        | Total    | 305      |nn### Budget for 10 workersnn| Role           | Amount | Quantity | Subtotal |n|----------------|--------|----------|----------|n| Curator lead   | 60     | 1        | 60       |n| Curator worker | 25     | 10       | 250      |n| Storage lead   | 40     | 1        | 40       |n| Storage worker | 20     | 10       | 200      |n|                |        |          |          |n|                |        | Total    | 550      |nn### Budget for 15 workersnn| Role           | Amount | Quantity | Subtotal |n|----------------|--------|----------|----------|n| Curator lead   | 70     | 1        | 70       |n| Curator worker | 25     | 15       | 375      |n| Storage lead   | 50     | 1        | 50       |n| Storage worker | 20     | 15       | 300      |n|                |        |          |          |n|                |        | Total    | 865      |,

      description: * The current storage lead has been in the role for an extended period of time, it would be good to have someone new try the role. This is important so that a small variety of people can try this role before mainnet. There has been discussion about implementing WG lead term limits: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/372nn* The lead has not been responsive in Discord for quite some time and has failed to produce a report since May 29 / 16 days (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/395?replyIdx=6). The reporting requirements for this role require weekly reporting and this has not been kept. Because of this there is currently no information on how much bandwidth storage nodes are consuming. A budget increase was made to allow for the additional reporting requirements (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/416?replyIdx=2) but because no reports have been produced KPIs and other parts of the platform are lagging behind.,

It is up to the community/council to decide if they want to replace any current lead of this Working Group. If this proposal is approved, and a user wants to choose a new lead, they must create a `fire lead` proposal first, and then a `fill opening` proposal--both of these should include reasons for these choices and it is up to the council to vote on them.nnNOTE: After this proposal is approved, people will have a final 24h to apply for this position.nnThe Council Secretary will not create any further propoals related to this.,

I would do measurements 3x per week.nn* The potential rewards are outlined in the description and each OKR includes a $10 reward for the lead and a 10% worker payment reward (this would be incorporated into a budget, if a new budget is agreed on before the results are measured then it will be added to the new budget. If no OKRs are met, then no rewards will be paid.nn* The measurement period will be the next council term (KPI 9.x)nn* Tests will be performed using `autocannon -c 3 -d 60` from two Linode servers. One running in London and one running in Frankfurt. These servers are not used for any other purpose and do not have anything besides autocannon installed (no nodes are installed).nn* This is the first run of OKRs on the testnet, so the system can be improved upon in further iterations.n,

      title: Storage Lead opening (term limit),
      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a `firing proposal` > also a `begin review` proposal and also finally a `fill opening` proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the `term limits` proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nnThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn1. The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.nn2. Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.nn3. Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.nn4. The current lead can also apply for the opening.nn5. Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn- a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)nn- also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.nnn- In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the councilnn- In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nn### Exceptionsnn- In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.n,

      title: Update OWG workflow,
      description: *I write this as deputy secretary but also with the interest as OWG lead to reduce the bus factor and pave the way for future Operations leads.*nnSo far the council was very laissez-fare with the OWG. It is however not new anymore and could need some more communication.nnThe [Operations Tasks & Budget Workflow](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/working-groups/operations-group/operations_tasks_budget_workflow.md) is not completely followed and needs some updates:n- The task list is not used. It could be included into the [README](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/working-groups) to increase visibility.n- Approved tasks linger forever because there is no incentive to complete them faster. Maximal approved rewards could diminish over time (eg. 10% / term).n- The need to estimate costs in advance and wait for approval reduces worker initiative with the effect that focus is on KPI. They deserve the option to take on problems and bill for their hours to some extent.nnAs the latest [performance evaluation](/#/proposals/851) points out, OWG reports contain a list of workers and their rewards but no information that justifies them. This way it is hard for the council (or JSG) to see what is actually happening.,

The tokens are given to users on a discretionary basis, depending on what the intended use is, and judged by how active the person has been on the platform.nnIn the past it has been funded by Jsgenesis and by myself (I accidentally used the address for a council secretary payment) so I would like to request from the council 3 million tokens to replenish this account. The current balance is 520396 JOY.,

Now there are 4.7 M tJoys ($180) left. To pay for posting a video, we need 17,927,784 tJoes ($670.5). I also consider it wrong to reward myself, I suggest paying $40/week. So we need 13,158,184 tJoys to cover the latest videos + my reward for being a content manager. For the next payments, I will create another proposal.nFrom https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/292?page=18&replyIdx=144 to https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/292?page=18&replyIdx=197 n,

It is up to the person making the firing proposal on whether or not to fully slash the lead's funds.n- If the Lead fails to produce 2 (two) reports they should be warned.n- If the Lead fail to produce 3 (three) reports in a row they can be fired.

      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a firing proposal > also a begin review proposal and also finally a fill opening proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn1. The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.nn2. Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.nn3. Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.nn4. The current lead can also apply for the opening.nn5. Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

In a 7 second long videonn* If this proposal is approved, I will do a trial run of this competition for the next month. No funding is required from the council at this stage.nn* Every entry will be a 7 second long video, that is GPLv3 licensed. It will be weekly a competition that aligns with the timing of each council session (currently weekly). It will require the user to post their entry in a forum thread created each week for this purpose. Entries can be as high quality or low quality as liked. The only other stipulations are mentioned in the `Entry Requirements` section.nn* There are 212 days left until the end of Q4 2021 (when Joystream is scheduled to be fully released), this makes about 30 weeks. If we combine all of the weekly winners of this competition we can produce a community video that is up to `7 seconds * 30 weeks = 3.5 minutes` long video that showcases the culture of the platform. This video can be compiled and will show new users the culture of the community.nn* The voting process will take place in Discord. Entries will be randomized and voting will be done via emojis as was used in the Community Repo banner contest: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/344 Eventually the competition will transition to using on-chain features rather than Discord. It will also utilize playlists and some other functions that are not yet deployed.nn(more information contained in the `Description` area),

      description: nThe closer we get to the launch date of the main Joystream network,the more important the role of community members in its management should become. nIn this regard, it is imperative to continually receive a summary of the issues and requests of the platform at specific points in time. nThe existing forum system with its discussions and suggestions is undoubtedly such.However, it lacks a system of analytical reporting,nwhich,in my opinion, could form an objective understanding of the current state of affairs and problems on the platform by the councilnand the community as a whole. nThe work on this kpi will be to some extent routine, and to some extent creative.,

The curator has 3 workers now.nn* The curator would have capacity to hire another 2 workers. There has been a request for a technical role to be added to the curator group here (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/59) but it is still pending, and it is unclear if this would have a different reward.nn* The current storage size is 88.47 GB. During the last budget discussion, 3 weeks ago, it was 60-73 GB (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/355?replyIdx=1). The presented budget allows for a capacity of 160 GB. A blockchain node must also be hosted on all storage nodes, which we can guess takes about 20 GB with the current chain size. So I don't think any changes are necessary here just yet.nn* The storage directory will reset in the near future with the next testnet upgrade (https://blog.joystream.org/antioch-released/) so I do not think we need to put in place any major plans regarding storage at the present time.nn* I have not heard any complaints from the leads with regards to the previous budget, we also had 9 applicants for the storage workers which is a record.nn* I linked the budget discussion to both WG leads.nn* We still have not agreed on reporting requirements, which may affect workload.,

The results of the work done by the bounty manager will be checked by the secretary and the lead curator, only in case of a positive assessment, further actions are possible to pay for the work of the BM as well as payments to bounty participants 18.nnRegarding the addition to the existing rules, the links to which are indicated above, I propose to add the following.nnNotation:nThis addition only applies to users who will participate in bounty 18.nnPublishing rules, in bounty 18 in the forum thread!nnVideos without specifying all the points described below WILL NOT BE CONFIRMED!nn1. Link to your video in Atlasnn2. Video title (short description of the video)nn3. Video duration (at least 1 minute)nn4. Video categorynn5. LicensennWorkflow and deadlines (internal rules do not apply to Bounty 18 participants)nnRegularly, weekly, BM, from Monday to Sunday, looks at all new entries, checks each video in accordance with the rules and enters them into the table. BM is sure to include a short comment in the table as to why he thinks this video deserves such an award.nnEvery week a new thread is created on the forum for Bounty 18. When the week is over, BM can post a notice that the week is over and direct people to the new thread.nThe assessment of the work done by the BM, the secretary and the lead manager is carried out up to 2 days after the close of the week (Sunday). With a positive assessment, the remuneration for the work of the BM, as well as remuneration to the bounty participants, must be paid, (the deadline for payments is Tuesday).nnA table for this Bounty will also be created, the responsible BM, secretary and lead curator will have online access.nAn example can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E4iPjDiGjoVCgyNX_GmYPdmSDMMyGayJ/edit#gid=1461462558nnWhen changing BM, the table will be cleared, the new BM will not know the video score of the previous BM.nnHopefully these add-ons will help breathe new life into Bounty 18!

      description: In order to better organize the council, I think it would be effective to have an informal meeting on the first day (24h) when the next council is elected. The meeting would take place in the #council channel on Discord and attendence is not mandatory, it will take place over an entire day so hopefully a wide range of people can participate.nnIt would be great to see some Working Group leads as well as workers, and also regular community members and also content creators.nnSubjects we can discuss:nn* Workload. Is anyone currently experiencing an extreme workload? Is there any way we can improve on this?nn* The KPIs. Asking and answering questions and building some discussion on how to achieve them, in particular some of the ones that have been outstanding for quite a while.nn* Working Groups. How is each group doing? Is there anything the leads want the council to be aware of?nn* Budget. How is our current budget? Are there any increases or improvements needed? Do we need to start building a budget that will allow for a significant increase of uploads?nn* Bounties. The bounties currently have a massive workload, and we don't have an effective method of monitoring these yet.nn* Content rewards. Outside of the 2 video bounties, we haven't really explored way of rewarding new creators who use the platform. Is this something we should start working on?nn* The platform. Is the platform healthy? Do we have enough validators and storage nodes? How much larger can the storage directory grow before we need to take action?nnIf you can't attend during the first day, feedback after the fact would still be highly valued. I will attempt to make a set of notes after this informal meeting, and post them on the forum and in the council minutes report.,

      title: Reduce validator count 105 > 75,
      description: Discussion: https://pioneer.joystreamstats.live/#/forum/threads/729nnNotes:nn* I have chosen 75 as we currently have active validators with only 50-100k stake which does not help the security of the network.nn* The validator block production times have been erratic and increasing recently. This is bad.nn* The validator role is not super profitable currently, by limiting the validator count we can hopefully make it more profitable.nn* By limiting the validator count we can hopefully get more tokens used by nominators and validators, since it will create competition. This will hopefully bring us closer to the ideal stake:issuance ratio which should be `30%` but is currently only `18%` (this amount being low means validators are earning quite an amount less than they possibly could).,

      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a firing proposal > also a begin review proposal and also finally a fill opening proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nnThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn* The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.n* Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.n* Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.n* The current lead can also apply for the opening.n* Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.n* In the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* A guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* Also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

The current storage system is in poor condition so an increase in budget is warranted.nn![](https://i.imgur.com/tQaHjm1.png)nn* We are currently discussing increasing the scope and frequency of the storage lead reporting requirements, to account for this the lead reward has been increased. The storage lead must also pay for and maintain their own storage node which makes this role different than other roles on the network.nn* The operations budget has been reduced by $10 as some of the expected expenses (running endpoints) will not be hired via the group and will instead use `spending proposals`. Based on discussions with the operations lead and some people who intend to apply for the group as workers, we may have to use a system which combines WG payments with some form of `spending proposals`. The exact structure of this has not been decided yet.nn* There has been discussion of changing the budget system in the future: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/428 At this stage I do not think we are ready for this, but the `operations group` does use this system and once we have built a system that works and is accountable we can look at incorporating the same system into the other working groups. This would be a system where the lead is given a $ budget and produces a report of how they intend to spend and the council provides a list of tasks/requirements.,

The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn* The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.n* Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.n* Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.n* The current lead can also apply for the opening.n* Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.n,

There is another one with three (oxygen, maxlevush, zazik) still accepting applications.nnIf it gets approved, [proposal 929](/#/proposals/929) (which is about to get reset at the end of the term) or another fire lead proposal would need to get approved first, or it would have no effect. I am curious if the opening gets closed or remains in review period if this proposal is not approved.nnReward is adjusted to $60 /term at the current rate.,

The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.  nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:  nn## For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.  nThe process once 1 month has been reached:  nn1. The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.nn2. Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.nn3. Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.nn4. The current lead can also apply for the opening.nn5. Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.  nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:  nn- a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n- also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n- In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln- In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.  nnExceptions  nn- In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

      description: Discussion: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/485?replyIdx=3nnCurrently, WG's mints are limited to 5 million. This works for now but has problems with scaling meaning a lead has to submit multiple proposals per week.nnI request the mints to be increased to 50 million. This will allow us to move to self managed budgets, where the lead can request one mint refill per week. This I believe is in line with the future of the platform and will mean the Council only manages budgets from a high level perspective.,

Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.n* Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.n* The current lead can also apply for the opening.n* Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

I have spoken with @isonar on the #operations channel on Discord, and he has agreed to an amount of `$100` to check through all of these and provide his expertise on whether they should be merged. Most of these PRs relate to bots and other scripts that the `community-repo` currently hosts.nnIf this proposal is approved, @isonar will be assigned to complete this work and after completion will be paid the amount of `$100 USD` (at the exchange rate when the `spending proposal` is created) for this work.,

      title: Bill to Increase Council Seats to 25,
      description: I will give several reasons why this can be good  at that moment and will be useful for the platform and the community:nn1.While we are in the testnet, it makes sense to gradually increase the number of seats on the council, this may help to find the optimal number of seats in the council in the future. We can call this a stress test and see the resultsnn2. An increase in seats will give more opportunities for everyone to get into the council. At the moment, we must admit that there are problems for beginners with getting into the council, the threshold for getting into the council has not decreased, and it is difficult for them to get there without someone else's support. The system where genesis supported newcomers , has already outlived its usefulness, it happens that they do not even read the topic where the newcomers introduce themselves, in that topic you can just sing songs and you will not be heard.nn3. Last election we had 38 candidates for 20 seats. Competition is getting tougher.Old people have accumulated large sums and such competition for newcomers may seem unfair.Many have already applied to the council 10 times and cannot get in in any way.nn4.We need more fresh thoughts, an influx of new talents, new blood. Council will become easier to get to and it will contribute to development.nn5.Who knows, maybe we'll get one step closer to decentralization, which has been talked about so much this week, thanks to this.,

      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a firing proposal > also a begin review proposal and also finally a fill opening proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:nn#### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn* The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.n* Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.n* Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.n* The current lead can also apply for the opening.n* Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

[js:stats](https://git.joystreamstats.live/Operations/jsstats) will always stay work in progress and needs funding to keep up with all the promising new features in Giza and Olympia! With pioneer2 as new governance app  some pioneer1 functions need replacement. Also jsstats is currently overloaded and resource hungry because for some newly components chain data is fetched live. This will be solved by a better indexer. Let me share a draft roadmap and ask JSG to think about reimbursing the development costs.nnNew visitors join daily and could use mentoring and guides as outlined in [38.II-7 - User Friendly API Guides](https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-kpis/#38.II-7):,

      description: The prize pot is running down, with 1.2129 MJoy ($42.81573 at 0.0000353 USD/Joy) left. As the average payout over the last week was $35.4375 (993947.875 tJoys with a varying exchange rate), there's every reason to believe the next Bounty request would be more than what we have left. I would thus like to request $300, which at the current exchange rate of 0.0000353 USD/tJoy, would 8498584, rounded to the nearest whole number.,

The amounts varied between 10k-100k and I used my own decision on who to reward. The process I use is described here: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/183nnThe idea is to create a continuous way for new users on the platform to have another way of receiving rewards and to reward high quality contributions.nnI'm creating this spending proposal to ask for 3m tokens to distribute to forum posts, the aim this time is to increase the reward to ~100-150k JOY (or more) for each post or thread that qualifies to help build up activity on the forums (for both posts that relate to the project as well as off topic posts).nnThe account the payment would be sent to is 5GW7KFL9dGPLKUVM8dHX4RPX6p3UXdmiJaVWtSthr39HVWfs which has the member ID of forumrewards. All of the tokens received would be used for the purpose stated and no tokens would be used by me for any other purposes.,

      title: Task: API improvements,
      description: ### API improvementsnImprovements: detailed here: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/509nReward: $150nn* This proposal is asking for some improvements to the Joystreamstats API (https://api.joystreamstats.live/api/v1/)nn* These improvements are specifically aimed at increasing the amount of information about proposals on the API, with the end goal of using this data on the Council Leaderboard (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l_aFoN2GxFpxi7pZS3rUh9wCsVHUi8um4YYiNRWMBW8/edit?usp=sharing). This would allow us to see information & statistics relating to all proposal types.nn* Currently only `spending proposals` are listed in a separate place (https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/governance/spending_proposal_categories.csv) on the `community-repo` and this process is done manually. It is time consuming and because it is done manually it means that human error can happen.nn* As one of the platform's core pillars, `proposals` are vital to better understanding their use and making sure that both JSG and the community understand how they are currently used, and how they might be used in the future.nn* If this proposal is approved, I have spoken with @l1dev and he can assign it within the `operations WG` (or do the work himself), however payment for this improvement will be done via a `spending proposal`--and it will come from the Council's mint and listed under the spending category of `Tools`. Part of the reason for this is it makes the process of payment much quicker and can be included in our total platform spending more easily (it is difficult to analyze specific task costs within the `Operations WG` due to how the testnet currently operates--this will change in the future),

      title: Storage Lead opening (term limit),
      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a `firing proposal` > also a `begin review` proposal and also finally a `fill opening` proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this `opening` proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the `term limits` proposal:nn#### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nnThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn1. The council secretary or deputy will create an `opening` for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.nn2. Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.nn3. Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.nn4. The current lead can also apply for the opening.nn5. Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new `opening` proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as: nn- a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via `spending proposal`)nn- also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.nn* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the councilnn* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nn#### Exceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the `opening` proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.nn4. The current lead can also apply for the opening.nn5. Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.n,

      title: A request to use the forums more,
      description: We are reaching a stage of the project where things are becoming more and more complicated. Communication is a highly important part of the testnet and eventually the mainnet.nnSome complex discussions take place on Discord or Telegram which is fine for small matters, but for more important matters, such as discussing the way working groups operate, budgets, inflation, warning/hiring/firing matters, problems with reports, or progress on specific projects and so on, please start to use the forums more. You can link to your forum posts on Discord/Telegram so that people know they exist. There is also a bot on Discord that announces new posts automatically.nnThe biggest problem with discussing these important matters on Discord or Telegram is that they get lost over time. We do not gain any value from these discussions being lost, because they do not add to the structure of the platform. The forum is an integral part of the platform and its structure is an important aspect of how governance works.nnA very good example of this structure being used is the `Governance` forum area: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/categories/12 There are clear places to discuss each element of governance, and it is clearly laid out for any new or old user to navigate.nn- If you want to make a thread about an issue, but do not know where to post it, ask!nn- If you have looked and there is no appropriate forum category, you can create a `text proposal` to request the creation of one (these are the categories shown on the front page of the forum, such as `General Discussion`, `Joystream Roles` and so on)nn- If you want to have a subcategory made (for example: `KPI Discussion` within `Governance`) you can ask me (@tomato) for this. I have the forum sudo key and can create these as needed (no proposals are necessary),

      title: Curator Lead opening (term limit),
      description: WG Lead Term Limits Proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/204nnMinimum Stake requirements: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/178nnNOTE: Before any lead is actually replaced, this proposal must be approved > also a `firing proposal` > also a `begin review` proposal and also finally a `fill opening` proposal must all be approved. The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this `opening` proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the `term limits` proposal:nn#### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nnThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn1. The council secretary or deputy will create an `opening` for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.nn2. Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.nn3. Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.nn4. The current lead can also apply for the opening.nn5. Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new `opening` proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as: nn- a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via `spending proposal`)nn- also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.nn* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the councilnn* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nn#### Exceptionsnn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the `opening` proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.,

      title: New Fiat Pool Scheme,
      description: The community is taking a larger and more involved part of the Council voting, much to our pleasure. Let's make it more meaningful for them to do so!nAn idea that's been discussed for some time now is the introduction of a way to increase the fiat pool based on the KPI performance. (c)JSGnnThe main problem with inflation is that it encourages the withdrawal of all the tokens that you earn as quickly as possible. And, despite the fact that with the mainnet launch, the current economy will cease to exist, the basic idea will remain unchanged - it is important to encourage people to keep their tokens and not withdraw them from the ecosystem.nnI propose the concept of how we can slightly change the economic model and make the size of the fiat pool (and, as a consequence, the token exchange rate) directly dependent on the effectiveness of the Council. I have outlined my thoughts in [this](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/612) thread.nn[This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rXxu6hRjtNycvVBiH4RoJ29CYNEtdTzf_PeCht6dFtY/edit#gid=0) table showing the past performance of the Council, the actual size of the fiat pool and how it would change over time if we initially followed the model I proposed.nnAs to which is better, linking to a fixed amount or to percents, I continue to lean towards the view that the $ target is much more predictable and controllable by CMs. The last week with the sudden addition of new KPIs is a good example of this.,

The council secretary's role is limited to creating only this opening proposal. It is up to the leads, council and community to work together to accomplish whether they actually want to replace a lead or not.nnThe exact text of the term limits proposal:nn### For current Leads the soft term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.nThe process once 1 month has been reached:nn1. The council secretary or deputy will create an opening for a new lead position, to see who is interested in doing the role. A proposal will then be created to begin review of applicants 1 week after.nn2. Once the review period starts, any user with enough tokens can create a proposal to fire the current lead and/or hire a new lead. Note: the current lead must be fired if a new lead is to be hired.nn3. Whatever proposals are made by the community (including by council members), the council can at this point vote on whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place.nn4. The current lead can also apply for the opening.nn5. Whatever the result of the new opening is, a new opening proposal will be made 1 month after, repeating the process.nnIn the event the current lead is fired, they can stay on as:nn* a guide (to help the newly hired lead on how to manage the position for a week). This will be paid at the previous rate + 50% for one week (via spending proposal)n* also as a worker if they apply for an opening. The new lead is encouraged to hire the old lead as a worker if there are enough places, since the old lead will have desirable skills to help with the group.n* In the event of a firing, the exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum with the old lead and issued as a text proposal for approval by the counciln* In the event of a firing due to the soft term limit, it should not be considered that the lead was bad at the position, this is just a process to try and get a rotation of leads.nnExceptionsn* In the event the current lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term before the opening proposal is created by the council secretary or deputy council secretary.n,

      title: Roles & Responsibilities on the platform,
      description: I have created a small document that outlines some of the roles and responsibilities on the platform, such as who is responsible for voting, who is responsible for checking the status of mints. These are not rules but more of a set of guidelines so new users can understand how things should hopefully work. It can be adjusted over time, this is just a starting point. nnThe document is accessible in the `description` of this proposal.nnPR: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/pull/211,
