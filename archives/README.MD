## Purpose
This folder serves as a historical archive of data from various aspects of the Joystream project. Owing to changes in the runtime and network upgrades at various times some data ended up not being recorded in any reliable format, for this reason this will hopefully act as a historical repository of information of the project's history.

## History
* A broad history of the project has not so far been completed, however extensive information is already available within the Joystream repo: https://github.com/Joystream/

## Contents
1. [Founding Member's Program history](archives\FM_history\README.MD)
2. [Partial Giza testnet archive](archives\giza_backup\README.MD)
