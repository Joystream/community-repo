### Weekly Bounty Report

KPI 12.7 (Managing Community Bounties) requires a weekly report to be submitted: `Submit a weekly bounty report, outlining the status and progress for each bounty`. The council secretary or if available a dedicated bounty manager is responsible for compiling this report.

This is the first report of this type, so the format is quite basic but can be expanded upon as the platform progresses.

#### Notes
* The governance system/council is currently experiencing a very high volume of proposals, this has made a lot of progress with individual bounties that require council work to be severely delayed or stagnated.

* The council still hasn't developed an effetive method of taking the bounties announced by Jsgenesis and agreeing on changes before they are announced to the platform. This has been partially addressed by the `Council Bounty Management` proposal (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/168)


#### Bounty documents
These files are required to be kept up to date so that the current status of bounties is accurately communicated to all actors on the platform.

#### Bounty Overview
This table gives a brief overview of the status of each bounty. Since bounties all have different requirements and cover different types of work, some may require a process to hire an admin before they can become "live".

`Council adapted` refers to the Council taking a Jsgenesis bounty and adapting it via the process described in this proposal: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/168

#### Bounty processes
Bounty processes are Github issues or forum threads that can be used to develop any processes required for managing bounties. It is important these processes pass through the governance process eventually and are improved upon over time. The goal of mentioning these processes in the report is so that people are aware of them and that they can be adapted, reused or improved upon which will make it easier for any future bounties.
