# Joystream Mainnet Bounties

## Process

Community Bounties are made available for the community to work on, with a reward available for completing some or all of the work for each bounty.

Bounties are created by the [Apps working group](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/working-groups/apps) and managed by @codefi_keys ([HR WG](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/working-groups/hr)) on behalf of the [council](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/council).

The bounties can be for a variety of tasks including coding, producing documentation or producing media content.

Tasks marked open can be worked on right away without confirmation, except if stated otherwise.

If you have questions about a bounty or want to apply, you should primarily use the [#bounties channel](https://discord.gg/dCM5Vf6z) and let others know to avoid that multiple people work on the same.

The forum is the primary place to suggest new bounties [here](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/449).
