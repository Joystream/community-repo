# Joystream Mainnet Bounties

*last updated: June, 20th 2023*

## Process

Community Bounties are bounties made available for the community to work on, with a reward available for completing some or all of the work for each bounty.

Bounties are created by the [Apps working group](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/working-groups/apps) and managed by @codefi_keys ([HR WG](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/working-groups/hr)) on behalf of the [council](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/council).

The bounties can be for a variety of tasks including coding, producing documentation or producing media content.

Tasks marked open can be worked on right away without confirmation.

The forum is the primary place to suggest new bounties [here](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/449).

If you have questions about a bounty or want to apply for a bounty, you should primarily use the #bounties [discord channel](https://discord.gg/jv458weD). If you plan to work on a bounty, you should let others know to get added to the table so that multiple people do not work on the same thing.
