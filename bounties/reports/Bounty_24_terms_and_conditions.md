# Bounty # 24 Terms and conditions

## Internal rules of Bounty 24 (related to the curator / BM)

For this, the Bounty will be allocated 1 curator and 1 bounty manager (who is not the current curator) reward for the work of the curator $ 25, reward for the work of the Bounty manager (who is not the current curator)  $ 25 for the reporting period a week, provided that their work is done with high quality and will be accepted.

The Curator or Designated Curators must ensure and ensure that no videos that violate any license or terms are submitted for BM evaluation. So their volume is solely limited by this, and they don't need to care if the video is too short / long, or if it has poor resolution, or that the participants did not go beyond any limits, etc.

They will be informed and must be qualified to ensure that the video does not violate any license, copyright or conditions. The leader appoints the responsible curator, whose task is to check and enter the data into the table. (BM's task is to check the curator's work and assign a reward for the video)

The Excel spreadsheet will be created and uploaded to Google Disk, which will be run by the designated Curator and Rewards Manager.
For a better view of the work, this table link will be available 24/7 for the lead curator and for JS.

* Checking the unloaded materials and entering them into the table will be carried out within a week by designated people.
The reporting period is from Monday to Sunday. Maximum 300 videos per week, upon reaching this number BM will close the week.
By the end of Sunday, the table should be ready and sent for review. To the secretary of the council.

* It is the responsibility of the curator to create a new list / table of only approved contributions, published in any convenient way, where he adds all videos that need to be rated by BM.
This list should include (video id, username, forum link, rating / payout).

* Flag for Designated Curator - If a single video uploaded by a user appears to be inappropriate, regardless of the violation, remove all of that user's videos in that batch.

`Disqualifications
Anything that does not include a source clearly showing that the video is properly licensed should be immediately excluded from any fees.
Anything of low quality should be ruled out. This includes very short videos of up to 1 minute, or any videos that the curator thinks have a questionable source.`

## Workflow and deadlines

* Users submitting videos for this award are responsible for checking the status.

* For each week, a new thread is created for Bounty 24 on the forum.
When the week is over, the bounty manager / curator group can post a notice that the week is over and direct people to a new thread.

* At regular intervals, on a weekly basis, the curator appointed as the lead curator, from Monday morning to Sunday evening, reviews all new entries and checks each video according to the rules and enters them into the table.

* BM starts checking the curator's work on Sunday (deadline Monday)
* BM evaluates all videos based on predefined criteria, generates cost proposals from the Board, and pays out to winners (deadline for payments Tuesday)

`Bounty Budget 24 ($ 300 per week) If the budget is not depleted, the balance does not carry over to the next week.`
