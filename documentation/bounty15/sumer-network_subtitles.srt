00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,040
Hi and welcome to this second installment of the first Joystream community update.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:16,400
So, this segment is about the Sumer network which is a network we’ve been working on for about, I want to say, three months now.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:25,030
It is going to be building on Antioch which either is going to be released or has just been released depending on when this video comes out.

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:32,320
So, the goal in the Sumer network is to do three separate things.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,640
First of all, we want to introduce the next and I want to say final iteration of our on-chain content directory.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,710
I am going to explain this in further detail but I am just going over the overview.

7
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,030
Then we are going to introduce Atlas Studio which is new part of the Atlas product.

8
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,280
And then we are going to introduce a new working group which we are calling the operations working group.

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
So, let’s go through this.

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,680
So, the new content directory.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,039
The new content directory is an enhancement over the existing one and through pretty important ways.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,430
I am going to go though what the content directory actually is as in the next slide but just let’s dwell on this for a moment.

13
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,840
The first one is that it is radically simplified.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:26,400
The existing content directory that we had was actually very very complex because we were trying to achieve the goal of having the community to be able to update

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,960
what is in the content directory, so stuff like videos and channels, and playlists without having to do runtime upgrades.

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:45,680
So, runtime upgrades, as I probably have mentioned prior to this in this community update, is a way in substrate chains you can change the rules of the system.

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,880
So, for example, you can imagine at one point in time a video has a title, and then at some later point in time maybe a video has a title

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:07,520
and also what language the content of the video is recorded in or what language the people in the video speak or something like that.

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:15,200
So, that's a relatively small thing to change but you want to make it easier for the community to change stuff like that,

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,280
and if changing every little thing like that requires a community update, it's going to be really hard for the community

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,310
to iterate quickly on this part of the platform which really needs to be very flexible.

22
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:36,310
If you wanted to introduce other things, not just videos, let's say you wanted to introduce like eBooks or, you know,

23
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,760
some other mild variation of what we already have, it would also be very inhibiting if you'd have to do a runtime upgrade because we have to do a runtime upgrade,

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:59,510
you have to dive into the rust code, you have to change it, you have to figure out how to take all the old stuff in your state and turn it into the new stuff through a migration step that runs inside of the consensus of your
blockchain,

25
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:08,230
you have to update all sorts of dependencies and libraries and infrastructure to reflect how the new system works, you have to test a lot in advance.

26
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:16,560
I mean, if you do it significantly, if the change is significantly big, you should probably also do a test,

27
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:25,040
integration test where you run through a simulated upgrade with some representative state in your system,

28
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,000
you see how it works after the runtime upgrade, does your account still work, does your voting system still work, and so on.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
So, it's a lot of work.

30
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,120
And if you make a mistake, you can permanently destroy your chain.

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:45,200
So, it’s risky, it's hard, and it's, you know, requires a lot of care.

32
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:54,080
So this is a very long-winded way of explaining why we ended up having the old content directory that we had.

33
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:05,280
And the point of that content directory was that it was sort of very abstract, almost to the extent that it was like a relational database where it allowed the community to define schemas

34
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:15,280
and concepts on chain so that you didn't have to do runtime upgrades to define new things or change the way things were represented.

35
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,000
That's great. The problem was that it was extremely complicated.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,320
It became really hard to both have work properly on chain, it became really hard for people to understand how it worked.

37
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:36,400
And really what it turned out to be was that you couldn't even get something that was all that flexible, so you couldn't actually get all the flexibility that you wanted.

38
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,360
So, what we did in this release is we just said screw it.

39
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:47,040
What we're going to do is we're going to put the heart of what it means to be in the content directory on chain,

40
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:57,520
and then we're going to make the metadata associated with all the different things on the chain, such as videos and channels, and so on.

41
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,440
We're going to make sure that that's actually very easy to change.

42
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:12,240
So, you don't need to change the low-level business logic of the chain itself in order to make the sort of smaller tweaks that I described,

43
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
such as the fact that a video may have

44
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,440
a language So, you sort of lift that out of the chain entirely.

45
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,750
We also just decided that this is the way our content directory is supposed to work.

46
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,199
So, that's a pretty big decision.

47
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,639
And that's what's landing in Sumer.

48
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,280
So, let me go through now, just very quickly.

49
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:43,030
So, the video of myself which is not that useful is covering up a part of the diagram which is useful.

50
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,680
What's supposed to be there is a square which shows the unchanged storage system.

51
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,120
I’m going to figure out later whether I change that or not but let's just go with the flow.

52
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,600
So, the on-chain content directory has in this representation, as you can see, memberships.

53
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,190
Channels have within them stuff like videos, and playlists, and series.

54
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:16,720
All those actually exist in the chain but they haven't been fully implemented, and they will not be implemented in the consumer product like in Atlas itself.

55
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:29,120
These are people who are sort of employed in the content working group to manage and make sure that everything in the content directory is going according to plan,

56
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:40,240
and they can also own channels themselves on behalf of the platform to feature official platform content and that kind of stuff.

57
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:48,630
Now the interesting part here is that on chain you just have this sort of index of all these things, you know, what videos exist, who owns them and this sort of stuff.

58
00:06:48,639 --> 00:07:00,400
You also have an index of what data exists, so like the images, the cover photos, the actual video media files.

59
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:08,470
There's like a list of them you can think of or like a map basically which holds a representation of who owns everything,

60
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:16,800
how much space has member number X used out of all the space available to them to publish to their channel and so on.

61
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,590
And, of course, when the storage infrastructure is supposed to be replicating what part of the data.

62
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:33,910
Right now, of course, that's fully replicated in the current storage system but that would be changed in a future version which I’m going to get to in one of the later videos.

63
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,240
But basically, that index also lives on chain in the data directory.

64
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:47,440
And then of course the actual storage is on separate off-chain infrastructure and storage nodes that are also responsible for shipping the data to users.

65
00:07:47,440 --> 00:08:00,800
And, as you can see, one of the things that actually are possible in this release is for
things outside the content directory to also use data.

66
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,680
So, stuff like your membership avatars, we are aiming to have stored in the same storage system.

67
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:19,680
So, before, you know, for your avatar you really have to reference some URL somewhere but for what we're going to be introducing, the first step of that in this

68
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:28,630
Sumer release is that you could also store assets like that in the storage system itself just like the videos for the content directory.

69
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:37,200
Likewise, that could be used in other parts of the system, for example, as attachment in proposals or in forum posts and so on.

70
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,510
So, it’s going to be a general infrastructure piece for the rest of the runtime.

71
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,080
So, that's the first part of what we're doing in Sumer on the content directory.

72
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,440
The next step is that we're launching Atlas Studio.

73
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,390
So, Atlas is the sort of the viewer product where you can see videos and channels and so on.

74
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,950
And Atlas Studio is sort of the flip side of that experience where you can actually see all your channels, make channels,

75
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:13,510
upload stuff to your channel, manage it, delete stuff - basically like the channel publisher owner experience.

76
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:21,200
That really is a very big step in the direction of making it easier for people to publish content to the system

77
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,390
which before or at the current time has to be done through a command line interface which is a very rough experience.

78
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,120
I think I can show a few outtakes of what that experience looks like.

79
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,830
You'll have, you know, a nice experience for filling in the basic metadata and setting up your channel and editing it. 3

80
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:47,680
You will have a way to view all of your videos, and change and edit the
metadata associated with them.

81
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,950
You have drafts for stuff that you haven't committed to chain locally stored.

82
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,480
This all runs in the browser, just as Atlas itself does.

83
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:09,830
There'll be a smooth sort of upload flow for providing the media files and the basic metadata for videos in a step-by-step way

84
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:22,240
which ends with you signing a transaction which, now actually that's interesting, uses the Polkadot JS signer extension rather than the native wallet or,

85
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,360
I should say, local storage wallet that is in the normal Pioneer product that we're currently using.

86
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,800
So, that's also step in the right direction of having people use an external key manager.

87
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:47,200
So, there’s also, as I mentioned, we can store assets now like images on the
storage infrastructure, so that means we're going to be helping you set

88
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,270
and provide the right assets, manage how they're going to be displayed as part of those upload flows.

89
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:02,560
So, that's Atlas Studio which is the second major goal to launch for this release.

90
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:14,320
I also forgot, of course, we're going to be, if you have a look at the experience here for uploading and editing videos, you can see there's sort of like a tab system here,

91
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:25,040
and that's because we want to make it easier for people to manage multiple things at the same time.

92
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,510
With that, of course, comes the need to manage a lot of different uploads at the same time as well, so there would be a separate area to manage all the different assets

93
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,320
that are uploading at any given time. Uploads can fail, you could lose your connection and so on.

94
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,440
So, we'll have a graceful way for you to retry anything that hasn't worked in the past.

95
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,320
I don't think we could have had anything reasonable even in the CLI to make this possible.

96
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:58,720
This is a very big step in the right direction, and it's a huge effort from a lot of people, designers and developers and infrastructure pieces that are needed to get this to work.

97
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,320
That's fantastic.

98
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,360
Then the last piece of the puzzle is the Operations working group.

99
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,720
So, what is this? Well, I am going to get to what a working group is in a little bit more detail later but if you're a little bit familiar with Joystream,

100
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,720
you’ve probably noticed that there's the council and then there are these groups that are responsible for specific things,

101
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,240
and the operations working group is a new group like that, and what's special about it is that it's supposed to be

102
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:34,000
for any kind of activity that doesn't have at least yet an on-chain footprint or a role.

103
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:43,040
So, let's say if you're  a forum moderator, that implies that you can do certain things in the forum that other people can’t do.

104
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,760
There's an on-chain forum in Joystream, as most people probably noticed.

105
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,279
Likewise for the storage system and so on.

106
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:59,510
The operations group is meant for all of those activities we're currently doing and which will be part of the system in the future which don't really have any direct privilege on chain.

107
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:08,950
We just want to provide the basics of what a working group allows you to model - stuff like what the roles are so everyone can see,

108
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:16,070
it's transparent how people got into the roles, how they applied, what were the merits for people being admitted.

109
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:28,480
People have predictive, they have predictable reward schedules for what they will be paid, they have predictable stake at risk,

110
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:38,630
so they can be given a little bit more responsibility in terms of what they can do, what they can be tasked with on behalf of the group and of the system overall.

111
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,630
So, the examples we're going for at the moment are things like developers, we have at least one of the Founding Members,

112
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,560
I believe, is looking to be one of the first developers in the operations working group.

113
00:13:50,560 --> 00:14:00,320
In general, managers, marketers, anyone who would like you could think of almost like a role or a job but doesn't require you to do a lot on chain as VM.

114
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
So, that's the operations working group.

115
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,360
I’m hoping that this will be sort of a sandbox for discovering lots of roles that we haven't explicitly modeled into the system.

116
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:17,190
Maybe we will as a result of what we find out but I think it's high time for something like this.

117
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:29,440
What is actually… again my little preview thing is covering part of the image. I'm not sure, if I can actually move it now. Can I do that?

118
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:43,190
No, I can’t. All right. So, I'll just try to explain. The goal of this is just to show how the working group fits into the overall system of Joystream.

119
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:54,560
There is some general information in this community update series so I'm sort of straddling the line between very general stuff and stuff very specific to the releases.

120
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:04,800
I think in the future we'll do some like deep dives where we try to go systematically through each one of these, and give you a more fine-grained and a thorough introduction.

121
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,630
I just want to sort of tease you with that here.

122
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:18,560
The governance system in Joystream is actually a lot more, it is deeper, I would say, than what you find in a lot other crypto system.

123
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:28,800
In a lot of other crypto systems, you just have a flat coin voting, sort of voting pool which has proposals.

124
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,680
Typically, they're actually limited to things like signaling and spending maybe in upgrading the protocol.

125
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,070
So, you don't even really have that rich of a portfolio of proposals to choose from.

126
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,240
In Joystream that set of proposals are very very very broad.

127
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:54,000
Of course, at the root, sort of the root of trust for the whole system is a coin vote which happens not on individual proposals but on election cycles where you elect a council.

128
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:06,830
A council is a sort of one actor-one vote where you have council members vote on proposals.

129
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,950
I think the current setting we have for that is every two weeks there is a new council elected.

130
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:20,070
I’m not actually at all sure we are confident about what that number should be on mainnet but that's what we have at the current time.

131
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:27,680
That's mostly just informed by what's practical in order to have new people in the community, learn what's going on.

132
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:36,800
We'll see, that's interesting, it will be interesting to figure out what that ought to be but anyway there's a council which lives for a council period.

133
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,190
The same, the members can stand for council, and they can be reelected for future councils.

134
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:55,190
The main responsibility of the council is to vote on proposals, and the proposals do the things that I've just described, including hiring leads for individual working groups.

135
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,630
There's one working group per subsystem you could think of it.

136
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:17,030
There's a membership subsystem which is primarily at least in the Olympia runtime, which I actually haven't mentioned,  but that's the third community update, I think, so it’s coming.

137
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,790
Prop is mostly preoccupied with invitations to grow the membership pool.

138
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,720
You have the storage working group which is primarily about operating the storage system, storage infrastructure.

139
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,520
You have the forum for operating and curating the communication on the forum.

140
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,720
You have the operations working group that we are talking about here.

141
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:43,440
It's these different subsystems that run some part of what the overall platform needs to work.

142
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:54,080
Inside of each working group you basically have a leader which is someone who applies to occupy that role through a proposal to the council.

143
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:02,240
And that leader is basically responsible for spending money out of budget that is allocated to that group from the council for all sorts of things.

144
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:12,320
So, you can imagine, for example, if you're a storage working group leader then you need to figure out, well, how much money do we need for the next let's say month,

145
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,240
and then you have to go to the council to have them give you that much for your budget.

146
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:32,400
The leader is able to pay the rewards for himself and everyone else, all the other workers, as they're called, in the working group, for providing the service to the system.

147
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:41,280
The leaders are also able to change what someone has as their reward and can slash them if they do something they're not supposed to do.

148
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,600
And, of course, same applies to the leader with respect to the council.

149
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,120
The council can update the reward and slash them and fire them and all this sort of stuff.

150
00:18:49,120 --> 00:19:00,040
So, the working group is sort of the lowest sort of bureaucratic organ in the overall governance hierarchy of the Joystream system.

151
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,550
And we're getting a new working group in Sumer.

152
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:11,440
That hopefully was a useful introduction to working groups and the operations working group.

153
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:23,910
I think that's the last of it, so thank you for joining me for this Sumer update, see you in a bit.
