Hi everyone! And welcome to this first installment of the Joystream community update video series.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,280
so this is as i said the first

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,360
So, this is, as I said, the first installment of many to come 

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,800
in an effort to try to share a little bit more effectively what it is we are working on, what is coming down the pipe, what’s happening in the community.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,350
Just to try to bring everyone up to speed on where we are going and the road to mainnet basically. 

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:33,840
So, in this first episode I’m going to be covering first of the three next immediate networks – Antioch, Sumer, and Olympia, in that order. 

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,200
Then I am going to be covering Hydra which is sort of an infrastructure piece which is part of making all these networks

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,120
possible and really important for delivering the main products we are working on that are consumer-facing – Atlas and Pioneer.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:01:01,030
Then I am going to try to go through the community side – what are we doing, what is the point of the different initiatives, what is the status, and, of course, least but not last, well, last but not least,

10
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:12,470
the different new specifications that we have prepared for new exciting improvements that are coming after Olympia. 

11
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,110
So, I guess I should say a little bit more about what the point is of these update series. 

12
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:28,640
If you have been following us for a while, if you are even inside of JS Genesis trying to build this out, I am sure you must have noticed that the technical and social complexity

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,370
of what we are trying to deliver has escalated quite significantly in the last six months or so.

14
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:42,640
And with any growing effort organization you are going to have a lot of difficulty trying to synchronize all that information effectively.

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,000
So, the point of this video series is we’ll just try to open up the floodgates informationally speaking 

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:03,110
so that people are more up to date on our sort of finer time scale in terms of what we are doing because up until now we have been making these network releases and announcements

17
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,000
that are themselves kind of quite brief on the details of what’s actually being delivered.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,160
You are going to have to dig into a lot of documentation and try a lot of stuff in order to learn to understand. 

19
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,040
So, it is not the best format for conveying where we are and what we are doing and what the point is. 

20
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:28,080
So, hopefully, these video series will go somewhere towards getting people synchronized on what we are trying to do, 

21
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:37,510
and it is not just the scope of what we are trying to do but the number of people involved inside of JS Genesis specifically has grown significantly. 

22
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,480
People are involved into sub teams, they are trying to deliver quite complex functionality but still isolated to some smaller part of the system. 

23
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:52,800
Then it is very easy to get lost and not see the sort of how everything fits together. 

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,870
So, it’s both for the benefit of the community and us, as an organization, to try to get up to speed and organized around what we are trying to deliver. 

25
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,870
So that is the goal and, hopefully, it is informative.

26
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:16,150
Please, give me feedback on what you think I should cover, how the format can be improved, and I will definitely try to take that on board. 

27
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,200
So, this is going to be a six-part series. 

28
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,400
This first update just to try to break it down, reduce the chance that I blow up one of these. 

29
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,480
Well, if I did it all at once, I think I would have blown up the recording so I think just breaking it up is good for everyone. 

30
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,080
So, the next episode, I think, will be about Antioch.

31
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
So, see you in that video. 

32
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,840
Thank you for joining me and enjoy!
