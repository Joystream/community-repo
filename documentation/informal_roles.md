Informal Roles

Currently, these roles don't fall under any working group but may be expected to be funded via `spending proposals`. This document serves to keep track of these roles for budget purposes. All of the payment terms of these are expected to be agreed on via approved `text proposals` or `spending proposals`.

These roles will eventually fall under the `Operations Working Group`.
