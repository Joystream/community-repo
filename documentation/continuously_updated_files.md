### Continuously Updated Files

Some files on the community repo recieve regular minor updates and it would create spam if proposals had to be made to update them each time. These files should be able to be updated on a continuous update without seeking approval from the council each time and the changes done should not be significant.

* `community-repo/documentation/spending_proposal_categories.csv` - This file is used to categorize the spending done by the council. This document is usually updated by the Council Secretary or Deputy Council Secretary and is used to understand how funding is used on the platform. Note that it only records approved spending by the council and does not set out budgets for use.
