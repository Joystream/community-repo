# Operations Tasks T-shirt Estimations & Budget

Curated Trello Backlog: https://trello.com/invite/b/TI0TA4Gu/34ba43123dfca16f4350c3c54f2bee52/operations-wg-backlog. Assigned budgets are indicative and non-binding, unless there is an approved proposal with the budget, or an active community bounty. Assigned T-shirt size indicates perceived complexity of a given task, from XS being the "easiest" to XXL being the "toughest".
