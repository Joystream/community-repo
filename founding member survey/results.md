**8. What can be done to make it "easier" for you to submit in the future?** - All the answers
| Answer |
|:-|
|Make submission process as easy as possible. Preferably via web UI. Without needing to think about a format of submission text. As less paperwork as possible.|
|report form similar to this to paste validator addresses and select kind of participation|
|Notify in the Russian telegram group|
|I don't know I have no problem now|
|reminders|
|Make submission more easier.|
|I'm thinking about it|
|maybe some platform where we can submit every thing we did to joystream|
|At the moment,it's ok.|
|I just need more time|
|Nothing, everything is great and convinient|
|Report submission form|
|simplify the process|
|It will help a lot if I know for what activity how many points are awarded. Then I would deliberately change course towards more reward.|
|the system of reports is very understandable for me|
|to be honest, I'm already used to it|
|I think i missed all the idea of this so maybe a guide on what this role is about and how it can be awarded can make sense. Sure, it is already done. |
|twitter posts|
|For me it’s quite easy as is, but probably for less technical people it might be a bit hard.|
|google form)|
|Process is already understandable|
|Notifications from TG Group admins and other members. I take this survey because Andy ask me.|
If there was an understandable form that could be filled out.
|So that points for the validator are awarded automatically, without the need to specify blocks|
|everything suits me|
|Make a google form, sending a report is very inconvenient and unclear what is needed|
|Maybe nothing , but as for me making raport can be changed with format|
|Clearly understand how many point i would get for certainly activities|
|I think the form of the report is simple and straightforward.|
|I make my proposal in a forums|
|Make an online form indicating activities and a report on the accrual of points|
|I am satisfied with everything, points are awarded fairly, and I would not like to change anything|
|For me personally, everything seems to be fine! Thank You!:))|
|list of acivities for running period| 
|As for me , this form is great soluotion for beginners and excperienced  , so i can't say that it must be changed |
|I propose to create a telegram bot that will remind me of the end of the reporting period|
|сложно писать отчет. можно как то проще его писать например просто посты делать.|
|is there really not enough people willing to be members of the council or consuls?|
|Everything is allright|
|ну не знаю, может упростить форму?|
|google form|
|Change scoring period from weekends to week days.|
|more transparent conditions and that this will give the participant of the Council|
|it's ok|
|Accrupar to me the points)|
|подробное раскрытие дорожной карты командой проекта|
|telegram bot|
|I understand everything|
|I should try just once|
|Everything suits me|
|define clear rewards for clear assignments|
|awarding the node holder|
|A suitable google form would be by the way|
|russian language|
|nothing, now everything is fine|
|easier way of submitting as I can't currently remember how to|
|Nothing, I'm used to it.|
|make easy tool to get actual validators statistics, change Keybase to Discord or Telegram, maybe prepare some  auto-generated templates for submitting reports in the current scoring period (date can be filled automatically for the current period)|
|this form of filing is acceptable|
|Make a convenient form on the website for submitting reports|
|email notification, how to fill examples|
|ю|
|To know when is the end of current period. |
|Make a webpage with online reporting and logging.|
|The "validator" report could be simplified a lot|
|More information about the scoring period, plus regular reminders|
|No screenshot for node), i don't like to make it)|
|In fact, everything is quite simple, you just need to carefully read the assignments yourself.|
|With the updated UX I could easily notice the banner that I'd have to report activities|
|Raise awareness|
