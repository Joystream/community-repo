# PolkadotJS Browser Test

The extension is optimized for usability and hides complexity. Compared to the Pioneer UI where three algorithms can be selected for key creation the extension uses sr25519 for creation and is able to import other types as well (polkadot-js/extension#339).

The minimal password length is 6 characters while Pioneer has no restrictions.

Cross-chain keys have been tested with https://testnet.joystream.org and https://polkadot.js.org.

According to the [extension repository there is no `cross-device` functionality](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension/search?q=cross+device).
It doesn't appear to sync with remote browser profiles and users have to re-import keys for every browser / device separatedly.
