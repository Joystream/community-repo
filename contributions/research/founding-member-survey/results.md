These are the results for the **Founding Member Survey** https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-kpis/#12.7. The survey ran from July 9, 2021 to July 17, 2021. The survey had 71 responses.

From the results obtained, the following conclusions can be drawn:
1) More than 40% of respondents sometimes or never submitted reports either because they forgot or did not hope to get a significant number of points.
2) 19% of consuls have never submitted a report on this activity.
3) About 45% of the respondents did not include such activities as Council / WG / Bounties in their reports because they forgot, and also believed that they had already paid for it in tokens.
4) 42% of the respondents did not know that big points are awarded for participation in the Council / WG / Bounties.
5) Almost 70% were unaware of the fact that the amount of dollars earned for participation in the Council / WG / Bounties is equal to the points of the FM program.
6) About 90% of the respondents consider it possible to re-submit their activities.
7) About 40% of the respondents believe that the procedure for submitting a report should be simplified or improved. 10% Ask for a more transparent assessment and scoring procedure.
Some users stated that the points awarded are very insignificant, and sometimes there is no reward at all for the activity submitted, which is demotivating.

Separately, it should be said about the creation of a signature. This turned out to be a non-trivial task and was completely ruined. There were several reasons, but it is obvious that it is necessary to conduct additional clarification about the principle of this action.

**8. What can be done to make it "easier" for you to submit in the future?** - All the answers
| Answer |
|:-|
|Make submission process as easy as possible. Preferably via web UI. Without needing to think about a format of submission text. As less paperwork as possible.|
|report form similar to this to paste validator addresses and select kind of participation|
|Notify in the Russian telegram group|
|I don't know I have no problem now|
|reminders|
|Make submission more easier.|
|I'm thinking about it|
|maybe some platform where we can submit every thing we did to joystream|
|At the moment,it's ok.|
|I just need more time|
|Nothing, everything is great and convinient|
|Report submission form|
|simplify the process|
|It will help a lot if I know for what activity how many points are awarded. Then I would deliberately change course towards more reward.|
|the system of reports is very understandable for me|
|to be honest, I'm already used to it|
|I think i missed all the idea of this so maybe a guide on what this role is about and how it can be awarded can make sense. Sure, it is already done. |
|twitter posts|
|For me it’s quite easy as is, but probably for less technical people it might be a bit hard.|
|google form)|
|Process is already understandable|
|Notifications from TG Group admins and other members. I take this survey because Andy ask me.|
If there was an understandable form that could be filled out.
|So that points for the validator are awarded automatically, without the need to specify blocks|
|everything suits me|
|Make a google form, sending a report is very inconvenient and unclear what is needed|
|Maybe nothing , but as for me making raport can be changed with format|
|Clearly understand how many point i would get for certainly activities|
|I think the form of the report is simple and straightforward.|
|I make my proposal in a forums|
|Make an online form indicating activities and a report on the accrual of points|
|I am satisfied with everything, points are awarded fairly, and I would not like to change anything|
|For me personally, everything seems to be fine! Thank You!:))|
|list of acivities for running period| 
|As for me , this form is great soluotion for beginners and excperienced  , so i can't say that it must be changed |
|I propose to create a telegram bot that will remind me of the end of the reporting period|
|сложно писать отчет. можно как то проще его писать например просто посты делать.|
|is there really not enough people willing to be members of the council or consuls?|
|Everything is allright|
|ну не знаю, может упростить форму?|
|google form|
|Change scoring period from weekends to week days.|
|more transparent conditions and that this will give the participant of the Council|
|it's ok|
|Accrupar to me the points)|
|подробное раскрытие дорожной карты командой проекта|
|telegram bot|
|I understand everything|
|I should try just once|
|Everything suits me|
|define clear rewards for clear assignments|
|awarding the node holder|
|A suitable google form would be by the way|
|russian language|
|nothing, now everything is fine|
|easier way of submitting as I can't currently remember how to|
|Nothing, I'm used to it.|
|make easy tool to get actual validators statistics, change Keybase to Discord or Telegram, maybe prepare some  auto-generated templates for submitting reports in the current scoring period (date can be filled automatically for the current period)|
|this form of filing is acceptable|
|Make a convenient form on the website for submitting reports|
|email notification, how to fill examples|
|ю|
|To know when is the end of current period. |
|Make a webpage with online reporting and logging.|
|The "validator" report could be simplified a lot|
|More information about the scoring period, plus regular reminders|
|No screenshot for node), i don't like to make it)|
|In fact, everything is quite simple, you just need to carefully read the assignments yourself.|
|With the updated UX I could easily notice the banner that I'd have to report activities|
|Raise awareness|
|You just did it! You show, that it's important. So I hope, that the problem solved. I will try submitting in time. Thank you. With respect.|
