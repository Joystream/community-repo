# Council Election Round #12 - Performance Review and Minutes
## 1 - Basic Information
### 1.1 - Introduction
The council is expected to produce reports during each round and provide feedback in the form of workflow, challenges, thinking and performance as well as minutes covering important events during the council session.

Usernames referenced are Joystream usernames.
All times are calculated based on 6 second blocktimes and not actual blocktimes.
The Council Round number is taken from the chain, the KPI rounds have an offset number.

This report was compiled by @tomato with assistance from @freakstatic

### 2.1 - Proposal Overview
Proposal Types
- 29 Proposals Created
	- 9 Text Proposals
	- 17 Spending Proposals
	- 2 SetWorkingGroupLeaderReward Proposals
	- 0 SetWorkingGroupMintCapacity Proposals
	- 0 BeginReviewWorkingGroupLeaderApplication
	- 0 TerminateWorkingGroupLeaderRole
	- 0 FillWorkingGroupLeaderOpening
	- 0 SetValidatorCount
	- 0 AddWorkingGroupLeaderOpening
	- 0 SetElectionParameters

Proposal States
- 21 Approved & executed proposals
	- Token value of spending proposals: 9600000 tokens
- 1 Canceled proposals
- 0 Rejected proposals
- 0 Slashed proposals
- 3 Expired proposals
	-  Token value: 4720000 tokens
- 5 proposals passed to next council
	- These proposals didn't gather enough quorum in the current council term, so the votes are reset and passed to the next council.

Failed Proposals
- 1 NotEnoughCapacity failures
	- Token value: 5000000 tokens
- 0 ExecutionFailed

- Total time for proposals to finalize: 882.1 hours
- Average time for proposals to finalize: 38.35 hours
	- This average is calculated from all proposals, including canceled and expired proposals.
	- Proposals which are not successfully voted by the current council are considered finalized at the final blockheight of the current council. So if the current council has 50 hours to vote on proposal, but does not fully vote and the proposal is passed onto the next council, this 50 hours is included in the average time to finalize.

## 3 - Review
### 3.1 - Workflow, Performance, Challenged & Thinking
* @tomato
	* The increased council size doesn't seem to have affected how long proposals take to pass. I was expecting that proposals might be quicker to be voted on but this isn't the case. It does look as if many proposals sit in a period of waiting for one final vote to finalize, this may just be down to the current council.
	* The concurrent proposal limit has been a severe restriction on many things. Even though its being addressed soon it does highlight the importance of having tools for CMs to know which proposals are active and require votes. It also highlights that it isn't viable to try and rush through proposals since the time for quorum remains about the same. It seems as though anyone submitting a proposal for "platform purposes" (such as refilling a WG mint or submitting a report) should submit these knowing they take about 34 hours and while it is possible to ask for things to be voted in sooner, it isn't reliable to do so.
	* The council processes are still developing and its clear that over time they will improve. For now incorporating all of these processes and making things fair for all participants on the platform (ex. ensuring people get a say about bounties before they are published) take a serious amount of time. The time required for these things isn't easy to define but its obviously something to take into consideration when trying to adjust things or to create a new bounty.
	* I've started creating calendars for each council session which paint a clearer picture of not only KPI deadlines but what areas of the council need more attention (such as reports). There is also a spending proposal overview that I'll be trying to issue after each council term which goes a long way in helping to understand what the council mints tokens for. These two documents as well as the council report, tokenomics report and eventually some other documents look as if they will become core components in communicating well what it is that the council does.
	* Towards the end of the term, it appears the council voting slowed down quite a bit
	* Creative proposals being submitted seems to cause people to not want to vote. This can be better managed by creating more competitions with managers in the future.
	* We're still facing some issues with inactive council members, there were 2 CMs who didn't vote on any proposals this term (https://joystreamstats.live/councils)

## 4 - Obligations
Council obligations are payments or items that carry through council sessions. These are noted so that future councils can easily see what items they should be aware of. Items can be removed from here once they have been resolved or become outdated.

### 4.1 Current Documents / Processes
- Council Report
	- Each council should produce a report which highlights important events, council participation, mint spending and other important facts surrounding the council term
- Council Budget
	- This is a proposal which tries to guide how many tokens the current council may have available to it during a term. This is a non binding proposal, so is mainly used as a guide for now.

### 4.2 Regular Payments / Proposals
- Council Mint
	- The council mint needs to be checked on a regular basis and in the event it is near depletion, a council member should notify a member of Jsgenesis in order for it to be refilled.
	- The council mint is set at a value decided by Jsgenesis.
- Council Roles
	- Council Secretary
		- This role was introduced in Council Round #18 and the current payment is 2 million tokens per council round
- Content Curator Mint
	- The Content Curator Mint currently has a maximum value of 5 million tokens.
	- The Content Curator Mint has to be filled periodically and the agreed amount was discussed earlier. The amount may change in the future, but the rewards for this role are dependent on the council passing these proposals in a timely fashion.
	- The Content Curator Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
- Storage Mint
	- The Storage Mint currently has a maximum value of 5 million tokens.
	- This mint has be refilled periodically
	- The Storage Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
