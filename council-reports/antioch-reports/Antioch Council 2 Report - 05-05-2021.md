	- 4 Spending Proposals
	- 2 SetWorkingGroupLeaderReward Proposals
	- 0 SetWorkingGroupMintCapacity Proposals
	- 0 BeginReviewWorkingGroupLeaderApplication
	- 0 TerminateWorkingGroupLeaderRole
	- 0 FillWorkingGroupLeaderOpening
	- 0 SetValidatorCount
	- 0 AddWorkingGroupLeaderOpening
	- 0 SetElectionParameters
	- 0 RuntimeUpgrade

Proposal States
- 11 Approved & executed proposals
	- Token value of spending proposals: 21,542,200 tokens
- 2 Canceled proposals
- 0 Rejected proposals
- 0 Slashed proposals
- 0 Expired proposals
- 0 proposals passed to next council
	- These proposals didn't gather enough quorum in the current council term, so the votes are reset and passed to the next council.

Failed Proposals
- 0 NotEnoughCapacity failures
	- Token value: 0 tokens
- 0 ExecutionFailed

- Total time for proposals to finalize: 99.95 hours
- Average time for proposals to finalize: 9.06 hours
	- This average is calculated from all proposals, including expired proposals but excluding canceled proposals.
	- Proposals which are not successfully voted by the current council are considered finalized at the final blockheight of the current council. So if the current council has 50 hours to vote on proposal, but does not fully vote and the proposal is passed onto the next council, this 50 hours is included in the average time to finalize.

## 4 - Obligations
Council obligations are payments or items that carry through council sessions. These are noted so that future councils can easily see what items they should be aware of. Items can be removed from here once they have been resolved or become outdated.

### 4.1 Current Documents / Processes
- Council Report
	- Each council should produce a report which highlights important events, council participation, mint spending and other important facts surrounding the council term
- Council Budget
	- This is a proposal which tries to guide how many tokens the current council may have available to it during a term. This is a non binding proposal, so is mainly used as a guide for now.

### 4.2 Regular Payments / Proposals
- Council Mint
	- The council mint needs to be checked on a regular basis and in the event it is near depletion, a council member should notify a member of Jsgenesis in order for it to be refilled.
	- The council mint is set at a value decided by Jsgenesis.
- Council Roles
	- Council Secretary
		- This role was introduced in Council Round #18 and the payments are now managed by KPI rewards.
- Content Curator Mint
	- The Content Curator Mint currently has a maximum value of 5 million tokens.
	- The Content Curator Mint has to be filled periodically and the agreed amount was discussed earlier. The amount may change in the future, but the rewards for this role are dependent on the council passing these proposals in a timely fashion.
	- The Content Curator Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
- Storage Mint
	- The Storage Mint currently has a maximum value of 5 million tokens.
	- This mint has be refilled periodically
	- The Storage Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
