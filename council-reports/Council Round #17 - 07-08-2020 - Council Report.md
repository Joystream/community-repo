## 3 - Review
### 3.1 - Workflow, Performance, Challenged & Thinking
@tomato
This council round had a few issues, mostly to do with council member activity. There were 5 proposals made to pay for the Telegram bot, but this completely filled up the allowed number of proposals, which delayed other proposals from being made. This was a big issue as the storage lead had already taken a significant amount of time and meant that our current set of storage workers had not been running storage nodes for quite some time, we should try to avoid this at all costs in the future because the community is very small and huge gaps in inactivity can make people become bored of contributing further. We also began using signal proposals to refill the council mint, this may take some time to be more effectively used, but I think we should try to aim for refilling the council mint in 2 week intervals. If the council mint is empty it not only means that spending proposals won't work, but also that council members won't be paid.
The KPI improvement proposal was voted through successfully but no council member submitted an improved proposal as required by the actual KPI, it seems we need to work on better communicating the KPIs to the council members in some way, for now I manually highlight some in the Telegram channel but it doesn't look as if council members are looking directly at these when needed. Two proposals failed due to CM inactivity, but these were submitted towards the end of the council term. The only option right now is for the creator of a proposal like this to withdraw (which costs tokens) are resubmit immediately after the new council begins. This is not ideal but is a system limitation for now that will need to be addressed in the future as it makes the later stages of the council term problematic for submitting proposals.
Currently we also have a backlog of work that the council should be taking care of. The 3 main areas of this are council reports, tokenomics reports and the community repo. With the new council secretary role these may be taken care of. The biggest gap right now is the tokenomics report which requires a bit of technical understanding to complete, but once the script has been created should be the easiest report to produce each week. We may have to look at discussing better incentives to get the tokenomics report completed.

## 4 - Obligations
Council obligations are payments or items that carry through council sessions. These are noted so that future councils can easily see what items they should be aware of. Items can be removed from here once they have been resolved or become outdated.
### 4.1 Regular Payments / Proposals
- Council Mint
	- The council mint needs to be checked on a regular basis and in the event it is near depletion, a council member should notify a member of Jsgenesis in order for it to be refilled.
	- The council mint is set at a value decided by Jsgenesis.
- Content Curator Mint
	- The Content Curator Mint currently has a maximum value of 1 million tokens.
	- The Content Curator Mint has to be filled periodically and the agreed amount was discussed earlier. The amount may change in the future, but the rewards for this role are dependent on the council passing these proposals in a timely fashion.
	- The Content Curator Lead role is expected to keep track of their mint level and any member of the Joystream platform can create a proposal to refill this mint.
- Storage Mint
	- The Storage Mint currently has a maximum value of 1 million tokens.
	- This mint has be refilled periodically
